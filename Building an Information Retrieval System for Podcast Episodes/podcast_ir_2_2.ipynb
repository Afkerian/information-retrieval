Jordan, a professor at Berkeley and one of the most influential people in the history of machine learning, statistics, and artificial intelligence. He has been cited over 170,000 times and he has mentored many of the world class researchers defining the field of AI today, including Andrew Ng, Zubin Garamani, Ben Taskar, and Yoshua Bengio. All this, to me, is as impressive as the over 32,000 points in the six NBA championships of the Michael J. Jordan of basketball fame. There's a nonzero probability that I talked to the other Michael Jordan given my connection to and love of the Chicago Bulls of the 90s, but if I had to pick one, I'm going with the Michael Jordan of statistics and computer science, or as Yann LeCun calls him, the Miles Davis of machine learning. In his blog post titled Artificial Intelligence, the Revolution Hasn't Happened Yet, Michael argues for broadening the scope of the artificial intelligence field. In many ways, the underlying spirit of this podcast is the same, to see artificial intelligence as a deeply human endeavor, to not only engineer algorithms and robots, but to understand and empower human beings at all levels of abstraction, from the individual to our civilization as a whole. This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast. If you enjoy it, subscribe and YouTube, give it five stars at Apple Podcast, support it on Patreon, or simply connect with me on Twitter at Lex Friedman spelled F R I D M A N. As usual, I'll do one or two minutes of ads now and never any ads in the middle that can break the flow of the conversation. I hope that works for you and doesn't hurt the listening experience. This show is presented by Cash App, the number one finance app in the App Store. When you get it, use code LEX PODCAST. Cash App lets you send money to friends, buy Bitcoin, and invest in the stock market with as little as $1. Since Cash App does fractional share trading, let me mention that the order execution algorithm that worked behind the scenes to create the abstraction of the fractional orders is to me an algorithmic marvel. Great props for the Cash App engineers for solving a hard problem that in the end provides an easy interface that takes a step up to the next layer of abstraction over the stock market, making trading more accessible for new investors and diversification much easier. So once again, if you get Cash App from the App Store or Google Play and use the code LEX PODCAST, you'll get $10 and Cash App will also donate $10 to First, one of my favorite organizations that is helping to advance robotics and STEM education for young people around the world. And now, here's my conversation with Michael I. Jordan. Given that you're one of the greats in the field of AI, machine learning, computer science, and so on, you're trivially called the Michael Jordan of machine learning, although as you know, you were born first, so technically MJ is the Michael I. Jordan of basketball. But anyway, my favorite is Yann LeCun calling you the Miles Davis of machine learning because as he says, you reinvent yourself periodically and sometimes leave fans scratching their heads after you change direction. So can you put at first your historian hat on and give a history of computer science and AI as you saw it, as you experienced it, including the four generations of AI successes that I've seen you talk about? Sure. Yeah, first of all, I much prefer Yann's metaphor. Miles Davis was a real explorer in jazz and he had a coherent story. So I think I have one, but it's not just the one you lived, it's the one you think about later. What the historian does is they look back and they revisit. I think what's happening right now is not AI, that was an intellectual aspiration that's still alive today as an aspiration. But I think this is akin to the development of chemical engineering from chemistry or electrical engineering from electromagnetism. So if you go back to the 30s or 40s, there wasn't yet chemical engineering. There was chemistry, there was fluid flow, there was mechanics and so on. But people pretty clearly viewed interesting goals to try to build factories that make chemicals products and do it viably, safely, make good ones, do it at scale. So people started to try to do that, of course, and some factories worked, some didn't, some were not viable, some exploded, but in parallel, developed a whole field called chemical engineering. Electrical engineering is a field, it's no bones about it, it has theoretical aspects to it, it has practical aspects. It's not just engineering, quote unquote, it's the real thing, real concepts are needed. Same thing with electrical engineering. There was Maxwell's equations, which in some sense were everything you know about electromagnetism, but you needed to figure out how to build circuits, how to build modules, how to put them together, how to bring electricity from one point to another safely and so on and so forth. So a whole field that developed called electrical engineering. I think that's what's happening right now, is that we have a proto field, which is statistics, more of the theoretical side of it, algorithmic side of computer science, that was enough to start to build things, but what things? Systems that bring value to human beings and use human data and mix in human decisions. The engineering side of that is all ad hoc. That's what's emerging. In fact, if you wanna call machine learning a field, I think that's what it is, that it's a proto form of engineering based on statistical and computational ideas of previous generations. But do you think there's something deeper about AI in his dreams and aspirations as compared to chemical engineering and electrical engineering? Well the dreams and aspirations maybe, but those are 500 years from now. I think that that's like the Greeks sitting there and saying, it would be neat to get to the moon someday. I think we have no clue how the brain does computation. We're just a clueless. We're even worse than the Greeks on most anything interesting scientifically of our era. Can you linger on that just for a moment because you stand not completely unique, but a little bit unique in the clarity of that. Can you elaborate your intuition of why we're, like where we stand in our understanding of the human brain? And a lot of people say, you know, scientists say we're not very far in understanding human brain, but you're like, you're saying we're in the dark here. Well, I know I'm not unique. I don't even think in the clarity, but if you talk to real neuroscientists that really study real synapses or real neurons, they agree, they agree. It's a hundreds of year task and they're building it up slowly and surely. What the signal is there is not clear. We think we have all of our metaphors. We think it's electrical, maybe it's chemical, it's a whole soup, it's ions and proteins and it's a cell. And that's even around like a single synapse. If you look at a electron micrograph of a single synapse, it's a city of its own. And that's one little thing on a dendritic tree, which is extremely complicated electrochemical thing. And it's doing these spikes and voltages are flying around and then proteins are taking that and taking it down into the DNA and who knows what. So it is the problem of the next few centuries. It is fantastic. But we have our metaphors about it. Is it an economic device? Is it like the immune system or is it like a layered set of, you know, arithmetic computations? We have all these metaphors and they're fun. But that's not real science per se. There is neuroscience. That's not neuroscience. All right. That's like the Greek speculating about how to get to the moon, fun, right? And I think that I like to say this fairly strongly because I think a lot of young people think we're on the verge because a lot of people who don't talk about it clearly let it be understood that, yes, we kind of, this is a brain inspired, we're kind of close, you know, breakthroughs are on the horizon. And that's scrupulous people sometimes who need money for their labs. That's what I'm saying, scrupulous, but people will oversell, I need money for my lab, I'm studying computational neuroscience, I'm going to oversell it. And so there's been too much of that. So I'll step into the gray area between metaphor and engineering with, I'm not sure if you're familiar with brain computer interfaces. So a company like Elon Musk has Neuralink that's working on putting electrodes into the brain and trying to be able to read, both read and send electrical signals. Just as you said, even the basic mechanism of communication in the brain is not something we understand. But do you hope without understanding the fundamental principles of how the brain works, we'll be able to do something interesting at that gray area of metaphor? It's not my area. So I hope in the sense, like anybody else hopes for some interesting things to happen from research, I would expect more something like Alzheimer's will get figured out from modern neuroscience. There's a lot of human suffering based on brain disease and we throw things like lithium at the brain, it kind of works, no one has a clue why. That's not quite true, but mostly we don't know. And that's even just about the biochemistry of the brain and how it leads to mood swings and so on. How thought emerges from that, we were really, really completely dim. So that you might want to hook up electrodes and try to do some signal processing on that and try to find patterns, fine, by all means, go for it. It's just not scientific at this point. So it's like kind of sitting in a satellite and watching the emissions from a city and trying to infer things about the microeconomy, even though you don't have microeconomic concepts. It's really that kind of thing. And so yes, can you find some signals that do something interesting or useful? Can you control a cursor or mouse with your brain? Yeah, absolutely, and then I can imagine business models based on that and even medical applications of that. But from there to understanding algorithms that allow us to really tie in deeply from the brain to computer, I just, no, I don't agree with Elon Musk. I don't think that's even, that's not for our generations, not even for the century. So just in hopes of getting you to dream, you've mentioned Kolmogorov and Turing might pop up, do you think that there might be breakthroughs that will get you to sit back in five, 10 years and say, wow? Oh, I'm sure there will be, but I don't think that there'll be demos that impress me. I don't think that having a computer call a restaurant and pretend to be a human is a breakthrough. Right. And people, you know, some people present it as such. It's imitating human intelligence. It's even putting coughs in the thing to make a bit of a PR stunt. And so fine that the world runs on those things too. And I don't want to diminish all the hard work and engineering that goes behind things like that and the ultimate value to the human race. But that's not scientific understanding. And I know the people that work on these things, they are after scientific understanding. In the meantime, they've got to kind of, you know, the trains got to run and they got mouths to feed and they got things to do and there's nothing wrong with all that. I would call that though, just engineering. And I want to distinguish that between an engineering field, like electrical engineering and chemical engineering that originally emerged, that had real principles and you really know what you're doing and you had a little scientific understanding, maybe not even complete. So it became more predictable and it really gave value to human life because it was understood. And so we don't want to muddle too much these waters of, you know, what we're able to do versus what we really can't do in a way that's going to impress the next. So I don't need to be wowed, but I think that someone comes along in 20 years, a younger person who's absorbed all the technology and for them to be wowed, I think they have to be more deeply impressed. A young Kolmogorov would not be wowed by some of the stunts that you see right now coming from the big companies. The demos, but do you think the breakthroughs from Kolmogorov would be, and give this question a chance, do you think there'll be in the scientific fundamental principles arena or do you think it's possible to have fundamental breakthroughs in engineering? Meaning, you know, I would say some of the things that Elon Musk is working with SpaceX and then others sort of trying to revolutionize the fundamentals of engineering, of manufacturing, of saying, here's a problem we know how to do a demo of and actually taking it to scale. Yeah. So there's going to be all kinds of breakthroughs. I just don't like that terminology. I'm a scientist and I work on things day in and day out and things move along and eventually you say, wow, something happened, but I don't like that language very much. Also I don't like to prize theoretical breakthroughs over practical ones. I tend to be more of a theoretician and I think there's lots to do in that arena right now. And so I wouldn't point to the Kolmogorovs, I might point to the Edisons of the era and maybe Musk is a bit more like that. But you know, Musk, God bless him, also will say things about AI that he knows very little about and he leads people astray when he talks about things he doesn't know anything about. Trying to program a computer to understand natural language, to be involved in a dialogue we're having right now, that ain't going to happen in our lifetime. You could fake it, you can mimic, sort of take old sentences that humans use and retread them, but the deep understanding of language, no, it's not going to happen. And so from that, I hope you can perceive that the deeper, yet deeper kind of aspects and intelligence are not going to happen. Now will there be breakthroughs? No, I think that Google was a breakthrough, I think Amazon is a breakthrough, you know, I think Uber is a breakthrough, you know, that bring value to human beings at scale in new, brand new ways based on data flows and so on. A lot of these things are slightly broken because there's not kind of an engineering field that takes economic value in context of data and, you know, planetary scale and worries about all the externalities, the privacy, you know, we don't have that field so we don't think these things through very well. I see that as emerging and that will be, you know, looking back from 100 years, that will be a constituted breakthrough in this era, just like electrical engineering was a breakthrough in the early part of the last century and chemical engineering was a breakthrough. So the scale, the markets that you talk about and we'll get to will be seen as sort of breakthrough and we're in the very early days of really doing interesting stuff there and we'll get to that, but just taking a quick step back, can you give, kind of throw off the historian hat. I mean, you briefly said that the history of AI kind of mimics the history of chemical engineering, but... I keep saying machine learning. You keep wanting to say AI, just to let you know, I don't, you know, I resist that. I don't think this is about AI really was John McCarthy as almost a philosopher saying, wouldn't it be cool if we could put thought in a computer? If we could mimic the human capability to think or put intelligence in, in some sense into a computer. That's an interesting philosophical question and he wanted to make it more than philosophy. He wanted to actually write down a logical formula and algorithms that would do that. And that is a perfectly valid, reasonable thing to do. That's not what's happening in this era. So the reason I keep saying AI actually, and I'd love to hear what you think about it. Machine learning has a very particular set of methods and tools. Maybe your version of it is that mine doesn't, it's very, very open. It does optimization, it does sampling, it does... So systems that learn is what machine learning is. Systems that learn and make decisions. And make decisions. So it's not just pattern recognition and, you know, finding patterns, it's all about making decisions in real worlds and having close feedback loops. So something like symbolic AI, expert systems, reasoning systems, knowledge based representation, all of those kinds of things, search, does that neighbor fit into what you think of as machine learning? So I don't even like the word machine learning, I think that what the field you're talking about is all about making large collections of decisions under uncertainty by large collections of entities. Right? And there are principles for that, at that scale. You don't have to say the principles are for a single entity that's making decisions, single agent or single human. It really immediately goes to the network of decisions. Is a good word for that or no? No, there's no good words for any of this. That's kind of part of the problem. So we can continue the conversation to use AI for all that. I just want to kind of raise the flag here that this is not about, we don't know what intelligence is and real intelligence. We don't know much about abstraction and reasoning at the level of humans. We don't have a clue. We're not trying to build that because we don't have a clue. Eventually it may emerge. They'll make, I don't know if there'll be breakthroughs, but eventually we'll start to get glimmers of that. It's not what's happening right now. Okay. We're taking data. We're trying to make good decisions based on that. We're trying to scale. We're trying to economically viably, we're trying to build markets. We're trying to keep value at that scale and aspects of this will look intelligent. Computers were so dumb before, they will seem more intelligent. We will use that buzzword of intelligence so we can use it in that sense. So machine learning, you can scope it narrowly as just learning from data and pattern recognition. But when I talk about these topics, maybe data science is another word you could throw in the mix, it really is important that the decisions are as part of it. It's consequential decisions in the real world. Am I going to have a medical operation? Am I going to drive down the street? Things where there's scarcity, things that impact other human beings or other environments and so on. How do I do that based on data? How do I do that adaptively? How do I use computers to help those kinds of things go forward? Whatever you want to call that. So let's call it AI. Let's agree to call it AI, but let's not say that the goal of that is intelligence. The goal of that is really good working systems at planetary scale that we've never seen before. So reclaim the word AI from the Dartmouth conference from many decades ago of the dream of humans. I don't want to reclaim it. I want a new word. I think it was a bad choice. I mean, if you read one of my little things, the history was basically that McCarthy needed a new name because cybernetics already existed and he didn't like, no one really liked Norbert Wiener. Norbert Wiener was kind of an island to himself and he felt that he had encompassed all this and in some sense he did. You look at the language of cybernetics, it was everything we're talking about. It was control theory and signal processing and some notions of intelligence and closed feedback loops and data. It was all there. It's just not a word that lived on partly because of the maybe the personalities. But McCarthy needed a new word to say, I'm different from you. I'm not part of your show. I got my own. Invented this word and again, thinking forward about the movies that would be made about it, it was a great choice. But thinking forward about creating a sober academic and real world discipline, it was a terrible choice because it led to promises that are not true that we understand. We understand artificial perhaps, but we don't understand intelligence. It's a small tangent because you're one of the great personalities of machine learning, whatever the heck you call the field. Do you think science progresses by personalities or by the fundamental principles and theories and research that's outside of personalities? Both. And I wouldn't say there should be one kind of personality. I have mine and I have my preferences and I have a kind of network around me that feeds me and some of them agree with me and some of them disagree, but all kinds of personalities are needed. Right now, I think the personality that it's a little too exuberant, a little bit too ready to promise the moon is a little bit too much in ascendance. And I do think that there's some good to that. It certainly attracts lots of young people to our field, but a lot of those people come in with strong misconceptions and they have to then unlearn those and then find something to do. And so I think there's just got to be some multiple voices and I wasn't hearing enough of the more sober voice. So as a continuation of a fun tangent and speaking of vibrant personalities, what would Yeah. And you think technically speaking, it's possible to help. I don't know the answers, but it's a, it's a, it's a less anonymity, a little more locality, you know, worlds that you kind of enter in and you trust the people there in those worlds so that when you start having a discussion, you know, not only is that people are not going to hurt you, but it's not going to be a total waste of your time because there's a lot of wasting of time that, you know, a lot of us, I pulled out of Facebook early on cause it was clearly going to waste a lot of my time even though there was some value. And so, yeah, worlds that are somehow you enter in and you know what you're getting and it's kind of appeals to you and you might, new things might happen, but you kind of have some, some trust in that world. And there's some deep, interesting, complex psychological aspects around anonymity, how that changes human behavior that's quite dark. Quite dark. Yeah. I think a lot of us are, especially those of us who really loved the advent of technology. I love social networks when they came out. I was just, I didn't see any negatives there at all. But then I started seeing comment sections. I think it was maybe, you know, with the CNN or something. And I started to go, wow, this, this darkness I just did not know about and, and our technology is now amplifying it. So sorry for the big philosophical question, but on that topic, do you think human beings, cause you've also, out of all things, had a foot in psychology too, the, do you think human beings are fundamentally good? Like all of us have good intent that could be mind or is it depending on context and environment, everybody could be evil. So my answer is fundamentally good. But fundamentally limited. All of us have very, you know, blinkers on. We don't see the other person's pain that easily. We don't see the other person's point of view that easily. We're very much in our own head, in our own world. And on my good days, I think the technology could open us up to, you know, more perspectives and more less blinkered and more understanding, you know, a lot of wars in human history happened because of just ignorance. They didn't, they, they thought the other person was doing this while their person wasn't doing this. And we have a huge amounts of that. But in my lifetime, I've not seen technology really help in that way yet. And I do, I do, I do believe in that, but you know, no, I think fundamentally humans are good. The people suffer, people have grievances because you have grudges and those things cause them to do things they probably wouldn't want. They regret it often. So no, I, I think it's a, you know, part of the progress of technology is to indeed allow it to be a little easier to be the real good person you actually are. Well, but do you think individual human life or society could be modeled as an optimization problem? Not the way I think typically, I mean, that's, you're talking about one of the most complex phenomenon in the whole, you know, in all of which the individual human life or society as a whole. Both, both. I mean, individual human life is amazingly complex. And so you know, optimization is kind of just one branch of mathematics that talks about certain kinds of things. And it just feels way too limited for the complexity of such things. What properties of optimization problems do you think, so do you think most interesting problems that could be solved through optimization, what kind of properties does that surface have non convexity, convexity, linearity, all those kinds of things, saddle points? Well, so optimization is just one piece of mathematics. You know, there's like, you just, even in our era, we're aware that say sampling is coming up, examples of something coming up with a distribution. What's optimization? What's sampling? Well, they, you can, if you're a kind of a certain kind of mathematician, you can try to blend them and make them seem to be sort of the same thing. But optimization is roughly speaking, trying to find a point that, a single point that is the optimum of a criterion function of some kind. And sampling is trying to, from that same surface, treat that as a distribution or density and find points that have high density. So I want the entire distribution in a sampling paradigm and I want the, you know, the single point, that's the best point in the optimization paradigm. Now if you were optimizing in the space of probability measures, the output of that could be a whole probability distribution. So you can start to make these things the same. But in mathematics, if you go too high up that kind of abstraction hierarchy, you start to lose the, you know, the ability to do the interesting theorems. So you kind of don't try that. You don't try to overly over abstract. So as a small tangent, what kind of worldview do you find more appealing? One that is deterministic or stochastic? Well, that's easy. I mean, I'm a statistician. You know, the world is highly stochastic. I don't know what's going to happen in the next five minutes, right? Because what you're going to ask, what we're going to do, what I'll say. Due to the uncertainty. Due to the... Massive uncertainty. Yeah. You know, massive uncertainty. And so the best I can do is have come rough sense or probability distribution on things and somehow use that in my reasoning about what to do now. So how does the distributed at scale when you have multi agent systems look like? So optimization can optimize sort of, it makes a lot more sense, sort of at least from my from robotics perspective, for a single robot, for a single agent, trying to optimize some objective function. When you start to enter the real world, this game theoretic concept starts popping up. That's how do you see optimization in this? Because you've talked about markets in a scale. What does that look like? Do you see it as optimization? Do you see it as sampling? Do you see like, how should you mark? These all blend together. And a system designer thinking about how to build an incentivized system will have a blend of all these things. So, you know, a particle in a potential well is optimizing a functional called a Lagrangian, right? The particle doesn't know that. There's no algorithm running that does that. It just happens. And so it's a description mathematically of something that helps us understand as analysts what's happening, right? And so the same thing will happen when we talk about, you know, mixtures of humans and computers and markets and so on and so forth, there'll be certain principles that allow us to understand what's happening, whether or not the actual algorithms are being used by any sense is not clear. Now at some point, I may have set up a multi agent or market kind of system. And I'm now thinking about an individual agent in that system. And they're asked to do some task and they're incentivized in some way, they get certain signals and they have some utility. What they will do at that point is they just won't know the answer, they may have to optimize to find an answer. Okay, so an artist could be embedded inside of an overall market. You know, and game theory is very, very broad. It is often studied very narrowly for certain kinds of problems. But it's roughly speaking, this is just the, I don't know what you're going to do. So I kind of anticipate that a little bit, and you anticipate what I'm anticipating. And we kind of go back and forth in our own minds. We run kind of thought experiments. You've talked about this interesting point in terms of game theory, you know, most optimization problems really hate saddle points, maybe you can describe what saddle points are. But I've heard you kind of mentioned that there's a there's a branch of optimization that you could try to explicitly look for saddle points as a good thing. Oh, not optimization. That's just game theory that that so there's all kinds of different equilibria in game theory. And some of them are highly explanatory behavior. They're not attempting to be algorithmic. They're just trying to say, if you happen to be at this equilibrium, you would see certain kind of behavior. And we see that in real life. That's what an economist wants to do, especially behavioral economists in continuous differential game theory, you're in continuous spaces, a some of the simplest equilibria are saddle points and Nash equilibrium as a saddle point. It's a special kind of saddle point. So classically, in game theory, you were trying to find Nash equilibria and an algorithmic game theory, you're trying to find algorithms that would find them. And so you're trying to find saddle points. I mean, so that's literally what you're trying to do. But you know, any economist knows that Nash equilibria have their limitations. They are definitely not that explanatory in many situations. They're not what you really want. There's other kind of equilibria. And there's names associated with these because they came from history with certain people working on them, but there will be new ones emerging. So you know, one example is a Stackelberg equilibrium. So you know, Nash, you and I are both playing this game against each other or for each other, maybe it's cooperative, and we're both going to think it through and then we're going to decide and we're going to do our thing simultaneously. You know, in a Stackelberg, no, I'm going to be the first mover. I'm going to make a move. You're going to look at my move and then you're going to make yours. Now since I know you're going to look at my move, I anticipate what you're going to do. And so I don't do something stupid, but then I know that you are also anticipating me. So we're kind of going back and forth on why, but there is then a first mover thing. And so those are different equilibria, right? And so just mathematically, yeah, these things have certain topologies and certain shapes that are like, what's it, algorithmically or dynamically, how do you move towards them? How do you move away from things? You know, so some of these questions have answers, they've been studied, others do not. And especially if it becomes stochastic, especially if there's large numbers of decentralized things, there's just, you know, young people get in this field who kind of think it's all done because we have, you know, TensorFlow. Well, no, these are all open problems and they're really important and interesting. And it's about strategic settings. How do I collect data? Suppose I don't know what you're going to do because I don't know you very well, right? Well, I got to collect data about you. So maybe I want to push you into a part of the space where I don't know much about you so I can get data. Cause, and then later I'll realize that you'll never, you'll never go there because of the way the game is set up. You know, that's part of the overall, you know, data analysis context is that. Even the game of poker is fascinating space, whenever there's any uncertainty, a lack of information, it's a super exciting space. Just to linger on optimization for a second. So when we look at deep learning, it's essentially minimization of a complicated loss function. So is there something insightful or hopeful that you see in the kinds of function surface that loss functions, the deep learning and in the real world is trying to optimize over? Is there something interesting as it's just the usual kind of problems of optimization? I think from an optimization point of view, that surface, first of all, it's pretty smooth. And secondly, if there's over, if it's over parameterized, there's kind of lots of paths down to reasonable Optima. And so kind of the getting downhill to the, to an optimum is viewed as not as hard as you might've expected in high dimensions. The fact that some Optima tend to be really good ones and others not so good. And you tend to, it's not, sometimes you find the good ones is sort of still needs explanation. Yeah. But, but the particular surface is coming from the particular generation of neural nets. I kind of suspect those will, those will change in 10 years. It will not be exactly those surfaces. There'll be some others that are an optimization theory will help contribute to why other surfaces or why other algorithms. Years of arithmetic operations with a little bit of nonlinearity, that's not, that didn't come from neuroscience per se. I mean, maybe in the minds of some of the people working on it, they were thinking about brains, but they were arithmetic circuits in all kinds of fields, computer science control theory and so on. And that layers of these could transform things in certain ways. And that if it's smooth, maybe you could find parameter values is a sort of big discovery that it's working, it's able to work at this scale. But I don't think that we're stuck with that and we're, we're certainly not stuck with that cause we're understanding the brain. So in terms of on the algorithm side sort of gradient descent, do you think we're stuck with gradient descent as a variance of it? What variance do you find interesting or do you think there'll be something else invented that is able to walk all over these optimization spaces in more interesting ways? So there's a co design of the surface and the, or the architecture and the algorithm. So if you just ask if we stay with the kind of architectures that we have now and not just neural nets, but you know, phase retrieval architectures or matrix completion architectures and so on. You know, I think we've kind of come to a place where yeah, a stochastic gradient algorithms are dominant and there are versions that are a little better than others. They have more guarantees, they're more robust and so on. And there's ongoing research to kind of figure out which is the best arm for which situation. But I think that that'll start to co evolve, that that'll put pressure on the actual architecture. And so we shouldn't do it in this particular way, we should do it in a different way because this other algorithm is now available if you do it in a different way. So that I can't really anticipate that co evolution process, but you know, gradients are amazing mathematical objects. They have a lot of people who start to study them more deeply mathematically are kind of shocked about what they are and what they can do. Think about it this way, suppose that I tell you if you move along the x axis, you go uphill in some objective by three units, whereas if you move along the y axis, you go uphill by seven units, right? Now I'm going to only allow you to move a certain unit distance, right? What are you going to do? Well, most people will say that I'm going to go along the y axis, I'm getting the biggest bang for my buck, you know, and my buck is only one unit, so I'm going to put all of it in the y axis, right? And why should I even take any of my strength, my step size and put any of it in the x axis because I'm getting less bang for my buck. That seems like a completely clear argument and it's wrong because the gradient direction is not to go along the y axis, it's to take a little bit of the x axis. And to understand that, you have to know some math and so even a trivial so called operator like gradient is not trivial and so, you know, exploiting its properties is still very important. Now we know that just pervading descent has got all kinds of problems, it gets stuck in many ways and it had never, you know, good dimension dependence and so on. So my own line of work recently has been about what kinds of stochasticity, how can we get dimension dependence, how can we do the theory of that and we've come up pretty favorable results with certain kinds of stochasticity. We have sufficient conditions generally. We know if you do this, we will give you a good guarantee. We don't have necessary conditions that it must be done a certain way in general. So stochasticity, how much randomness to inject into the walking along the gradient? And what kind of randomness? Why is randomness good in this process? Why is stochasticity good? Yeah, so I can give you simple answers but in some sense again, it's kind of amazing. Stochasticity just, you know, particular features of a surface that could have hurt you if you were doing one thing deterministically won't hurt you because by chance, there's very little chance that you would get hurt. So here stochasticity, it just kind of saves you from some of the particular features of surfaces. In fact, if you think about surfaces that are discontinuous in our first derivative, like an absolute value function, you will go down and hit that point where there's nondifferentiability. And if you're running a deterministic algorithm at that point, you can really do something bad. Whereas stochasticity just means it's pretty unlikely that's going to happen, that you're going to hit that point. So it's again, nontrivial to analyze but especially in higher dimensions, also stochasticity, our intuition isn't very good about it but it has properties that kind of are very appealing in high dimensions for a lot of large number of reasons. So it's all part of the mathematics to kind of, that's what's fun to work in the field is that you get to try to understand this mathematics. But long story short, you know, partly empirically, it was discovered stochastic gradient is very effective and theory kind of followed, I'd say, that but I don't see that we're getting clearly out of that. What's the most beautiful, mysterious, a profound idea to you in optimization? I don't know the most. But let me just say that Nesterov's work on Nesterov acceleration to me is pretty surprising and pretty deep. Can you elaborate? Well Nesterov acceleration is just that, suppose that we are going to use gradients to move around in a space. For the reasons I've alluded to, they're nice directions to move. And suppose that I tell you that you're only allowed to use gradients, you're not going to be allowed to use this local person that can only sense kind of the change in the surface. But I'm going to give you kind of a computer that's able to store all your previous gradients. And so you start to learn some something about the surface. And I'm going to restrict you to maybe move in the direction of like a linear span of all the gradients. So you can't kind of just move in some arbitrary direction, right? So now we have a well defined mathematical complexity model. There's certain classes of algorithms that can do that and others that can't. And we can ask for certain kinds of surfaces, how fast can you get down to the optimum? So there's answers to these. So for a smooth convex function, there's an answer, which is one over the number of steps squared. You will be within a ball of that size after k steps. Gradient descent in particular has a slower rate, it's one over k. So you could ask, is gradient descent actually, even though we know it's a good algorithm, is it the best algorithm? And the answer is no. Well, not clear yet, because one over k squared is a lower bound. That's probably the best you can do. Gradient is one over k, but is there something better? And so I think as a surprise to most, Nesterov discovered a new algorithm that has got two pieces to it. It's two gradients and puts those together in a certain kind of obscure way. And the thing doesn't even move downhill all the time. It sometimes goes back uphill. And if you're a physicist, that kind of makes some sense. You're building up some momentum and that is kind of the right intuition, but that intuition is not enough to understand kind of how to do it and why it works. But it does. It achieves one over k squared and it has a mathematical structure and it's still kind of to this day, a lot of us are writing papers and trying to explore that and understand it. So there are lots of cool ideas and optimization, but just kind of using gradients, I think is number one that goes back, you know, 150 years. And then Nesterov, I think has made a major contribution with this idea. So like you said, gradients themselves are in some sense, mysterious. They're not as trivial as... Not as trivial. Coordinate descent is more of a trivial one. You just pick one of the coordinates. That's how we think. That's how our human mind thinks. That's how our human minds think. And gradients are not that easy for our human mind to grapple with. An absurd question, but what is statistics? So here it's a little bit, it's somewhere between math and science and technology. It's somewhere in that convex hole. So it's a set of principles that allow you to make inferences that have got some reason to be believed and also principles that allow you to make decisions where you can have some reason to believe you're not going to make errors. So all of that requires some assumptions about what do you mean by an error? What do you mean by the probabilities? But after you start making some of those assumptions, you're led to conclusions that, yes, I can guarantee that if you do this in this way, your probability of making an error will be small. Your probability of continuing to not make errors over time will be small. And the probability that you found something that's real will be small, will be high. So decision making is a big part of that. Decision making is a big part. Yeah. So statistics, short history was that, it goes back as a formal discipline, 250 years or so. It was called inverse probability because around that era, probability was developed sort of especially to explain gambling situations. Of course, interesting. So you would say, well, given the state of nature is this, there's a certain roulette board that has a certain mechanism and what kind of outcomes do I expect to see? And especially if I do things long amounts of time, what outcomes will I see? And the physicists started to pay attention to this. And then people said, well, let's turn the problem around. What if I saw certain outcomes, could I infer what the underlying mechanism was? That's an inverse problem. And in fact, for quite a while, statistics was called inverse probability. That was the name of the field. And I believe that it was Laplace who was working in Napoleon's government who needed to do a census of France, learn about the people there. So he went and gathered data and he analyzed that data to determine policy and said, well, let's call this field that does this kind of thing statistics because the word state is in there. In French, that's etat, but it's the study of data for the state. So anyway, that caught on and it's been called statistics ever since. But by the time it got formalized, it was sort of in the 30s. And around that time, there was game theory and decision theory developed nearby. People in that era didn't think of themselves as either computer science or statistics or control or econ. They were all the above. And so Von Neumann is developing game theory, but also thinking of that as decision theory. Wald is an econometrician developing decision theory and then turning that into statistics. And so it's all about, here's not just data and you analyze it, here's a loss function. Here's what you care about. Here's the question you're trying to ask. Here is a probability model and here's the risk you will face if you make certain decisions. And to this day, in most advanced statistical curricula, you teach decision theory as the starting point and then it branches out into the two branches of Bayesian and frequentist. But that's all about decisions. In statistics, what is the most beautiful, mysterious, maybe surprising idea that you've come across? Yeah, good question. I mean, there's a bunch of surprising ones. There's something that's way too technical for this thing, but something called James Stein estimation, which is kind of surprising and really takes time to wrap your head around. Can you try to maybe... I think I don't want to even want to try. Let me just say a colleague at Steven Stigler at University of Chicago wrote a really beautiful paper on James Stein estimation, which helps to... It's views a paradox. It kind of defeats the mind's attempts to understand it, but you can and Steve has a nice perspective on that. So one of the troubles with statistics is that it's like in physics that are in quantum physics, you have multiple interpretations. There's a wave and particle duality in physics and you get used to that over time, but it still kind of haunts you that you don't really quite understand the relationship. The electron's a wave and electron's a particle. Well the same thing happens here. There's Bayesian ways of thinking and frequentist, and they are different. They sometimes become sort of the same in practice, but they are physically different. And then in some practice, they are not the same at all. They give you rather different answers. And so it is very much like wave and particle duality, and that is something that you have to kind of get used to in the field. Can you define Bayesian and frequentist? Yeah in decision theory you can make, I have a video that people could see. It's called are you a Bayesian or a frequentist and kind of help try to make it really clear. It comes from decision theory. So you know, decision theory, you're talking about loss functions, which are a function of data X and parameter theta. They're a function of two arguments. Okay. Neither one of those arguments is known. You don't know the data a priori. It's random and the parameters unknown. All right. So you have a function of two things you don't know, and you're trying to say, I want that function to be small. I want small loss, right? Well what are you going to do? So you sort of say, well, I'm going to average over these quantities or maximize over them or something so that, you know, I turn that uncertainty into something certain. So you could look at the first argument and average over it, or you could look at the second argument and average over it. That's Bayesian and frequentist. So the frequentist says, I'm going to look at the X, the data, and I'm going to take that as random and I'm going to average over the distribution. So I take the expectation loss under X. Theta is held fixed, right? That's called the risk. And so it's looking at other, all the data sets you could get, right? And say, how well will a certain procedure do under all those data sets? That's called a frequentist guarantee, right? So I think it is very appropriate when like you're building a piece of software and you're shipping it out there and people are using it on all kinds of data sets. You want to have a stamp, a guarantee on it that as people run it on many, many data sets that you never even thought about that 95% of the time it will do the right thing. Perfectly reasonable. The Bayesian perspective says, well, no, I'm going to look at the other argument of the loss function, the theta part, okay? That's unknown and I'm uncertain about it. So I could have my own personal probability for what it is, you know, how many tall people are there out there? I'm trying to infer the average height of the population while I have an idea roughly what the height is. So I'm going to average over the theta. So now that loss function as only now, again, one argument's gone, now it's a function of X and that's what a Bayesian does is they say, well, let's just focus on the particular X we got, the data set we got, we condition on that. Conditional on the X, I say something about my loss. That's a Bayesian approach to things. And the Bayesian will argue that it's not relevant to look at all the other data sets you could have gotten and average over them, the frequentist approach. It's really only the data sets you got, right? And I do agree with that, especially in situations where you're working with a scientist, you can learn a lot about the domain and you're really only focused on certain kinds of data and you gathered your data and you make inferences. I don't agree with it though, that, you know, in the sense that there are needs for frequentist guarantees, you're writing software, people are using it out there, you want to say something. So these two things have to got to fight each other a little bit, but they have to blend. So long story short, there's a set of ideas that are right in the middle that are called empirical Bayes. And empirical Bayes sort of starts with the Bayesian framework. It's kind of arguably philosophically more, you know, reasonable and kosher. Write down a bunch of the math that kind of flows from that, and then realize there's a bunch of things you don't know because it's the real world and you don't know everything. So you're uncertain about certain quantities. At that point, ask, is there a reasonable way to plug in an estimate for those things? Okay. And in some cases, there's quite a reasonable thing to do, to plug in, there's a natural thing you can observe in the world that you can plug in and then do a little bit more mathematics and assure yourself it's really good. So based on math or based on human expertise, what's, what, what are good? Oh, they're both going in. The Bayesian framework allows you to put a lot of human expertise in, but the math kind of guides you along that path and then kind of reassures you the end, you could put that stamp of approval under certain assumptions, this thing will work. So you asked the question, what's my favorite, you know, or what's the most surprising, nice idea. So one that is more accessible is something called false discovery rate, which is, you know, you're making not just one hypothesis test or making one decision, you're making a whole bag of them. And in that bag of decisions, you look at the ones where you made a discovery, you announced that something interesting had happened. All right. That's going to be some subset of your big bag. In the ones you made a discovery, which subset of those are bad? Or false, false discoveries. You'd like the fraction of your false discoveries among your discoveries to be small. That's a different criterion than accuracy or precision or recall or sensitivity and specificity. It's a different quantity. Those latter ones are almost all of them have more of a frequentist flavor. They say, given the truth is that the null hypothesis is true. Here's what accuracy I would get, or given that the alternative is true, here's what I would get. So it's kind of going forward from the state of nature to the data. The Bayesian goes the other direction from the data back to the state of nature. And that's actually what false discovery rate is. It says, given you made a discovery, okay, that's conditioned on your data. What's the probability of the hypothesis? It's going the other direction. And so the classical frequency look at that, well, I can't know that there's some priors needed in that. And the empirical Bayesian goes ahead and plows forward and starts writing down these formulas and realizes at some point, some of those things can actually be estimated in a reasonable way. And so it's kind of, it's a beautiful set of ideas. So I, this kind of line of argument has come out. It's not certainly mine, but it sort of came out from Robbins around 1960. Brad Efron has written beautifully about this in various papers and books. And the FDR is, you know, Benjamin in Israel, John Story did this Bayesian interpretation and so on. And he used to absorb these things over the years and find it a very healthy way to think about statistics. Let me ask you about intelligence to jump slightly back out into philosophy, perhaps. You said that maybe you can elaborate, but you said that defining just even the question of what is intelligence is a very difficult question. Is it a useful question? Do you think we'll one day understand the fundamentals of human intelligence and what it means, you know, have good benchmarks for general intelligence that we put before our machines? So I don't work on these topics so much that you're really asking the question for a psychologist really. And I studied some, but I don't consider myself at least an expert at this point. You know, a psychologist aims to understand human intelligence, right? And I think many psychologists I know are fairly humble about this. They might try to understand how a baby understands, you know, whether something's a solid or liquid or whether something's hidden or not. And maybe how a child starts to learn the meaning of certain words, what's a verb, what's a noun and also, you know, slowly but surely trying to figure out things. But humans ability to take a really complicated environment, reason about it, abstract about it, find the right abstractions, communicate about it, interact and so on is just, you know, really staggeringly rich and complicated. And so, you know, I think in all humility, we don't think we're kind of aiming for that in the near future. A certain psychologist doing experiments with babies in the lab or with people talking has a much more limited aspiration. And you know, Kahneman and Tversky would look at our reasoning patterns and they're not deeply understanding all the how we do our reasoning, but they're sort of saying, hey, here's some oddities about the reasoning and some things you should think about it. But also, as I emphasize in some things I've been writing about, you know, AI, the revolution hasn't happened yet. Yeah. Great blog post. I've been emphasizing that, you know, if you step back and look at intelligent systems of any kind and whatever you mean by intelligence, it's not just the humans or the animals or, you know, the plants or whatever, you know, so a market that brings goods into a city, you know, food to restaurants or something every day is a system. It's a decentralized set of decisions. Looking at it from far enough away, it's just like a collection of neurons. Every neuron is making its own little decisions, presumably in some way. And if you step back enough, every little part of an economic system is making all of its decisions. And just like with the brain, who knows what an individual neuron does and what the overall goal is, right? But something happens at some aggregate level, same thing with the economy. People eat in a city and it's robust. It works at all scales, small villages to big cities. It's been working for thousands of years. It works rain or shine, so it's adaptive. So all the kind of, you know, those are adjectives one tends to apply to intelligent systems. Robust, adaptive, you know, you don't need to keep adjusting it, self healing, whatever. Plus not perfect. You know, intelligences are never perfect and markets are not perfect. But I do not believe in this era that you cannot, that you can say, well, our computers are, our humans are smart, but you know, no markets are not, more markets are. So they are intelligent. Now we humans didn't evolve to be markets. We've been participating in them, right? But we are not ourselves a market per se. The neurons could be viewed as the market. There's economic, you know, neuroscience kind of perspective. That's interesting to pursue all that. The point though is, is that if you were to study humans and really be the world's best psychologist studied for thousands of years and come up with the theory of human intelligence, you might have never discovered principles of markets, you know, supply demand curves and you know, matching and auctions and all that. Those are real principles and they lead to a form of intelligence that's not maybe human intelligence. It's arguably another kind of intelligence. There probably are third kinds of intelligence or fourth that none of us are really thinking too much about right now. So if you really, and then all of those are relevant to computer systems in the future. Certainly the market one is relevant right now. Whereas the understanding of human intelligence is not so clear that it's relevant right now. Probably not. So if you want general intelligence, whatever one means by that, or, you know, understanding intelligence in a deep sense and all that, it is definitely has to be not just human intelligence. It's gotta be this broader thing. And that's not a mystery. Markets are intelligent. So, you know, it's definitely not just a philosophical stance to say we've got to move beyond intelligence. That sounds ridiculous. Yeah. But it's not. And in that blog post, you define different kinds of like intelligent infrastructure, AI, which I really like is some of the concepts you've just been describing. Do you see ourselves, if we see earth, human civilization as a single organism, do you think the intelligence of that organism, when you think from the perspective of markets and intelligence infrastructure is increasing, is it increasing linearly? Is it increasing exponentially? What do you think the future of that intelligence? Yeah, I don't know. I don't tend to think, I don't tend to answer questions like that because you know, that's science fiction. I'm hoping to catch you off guard. Well again, because you said it's so far in the future, it's fun to ask and you'll probably, you know, like you said, predicting the future is really nearly impossible. But say as an axiom, one day we create a human level, a superhuman level intelligent, not the scale of markets, but the scale of an individual. What do you think it is, what do you think it would take to do that? Or maybe to ask another question is how would that system be different than the biological human beings that we see around us today? Is it possible to say anything interesting to that question or is it just a stupid question? It's not a stupid question, but it's science fiction. Science fiction. And so I'm totally happy to read science fiction and think about it from time in my own life. I loved, there was this like brain in a vat kind of, you know, little thing that people were talking about when I was a student, I remember, you know, imagine that, you know, between your brain and your body, there's a, you know, there's a bunch of wires, right? And suppose that every one of them was replaced with a literal wire. And then suppose that wire was turned in actually a little wireless, you know, there's a receiver and sender. So the brain has got all the senders and receiver, you know, on all of its exiting, you know, axons and all the dendrites down to the body have replaced with senders and receivers. Now you could move the body off somewhere and put the brain in a vat, right? And then you could do things like start killing off those senders and receivers one by one. And after you've killed off all of them, where is that person? You know, they thought they were out in the body walking around the world and they moved on. So those are science fiction things. Those are fun to think about. It's just intriguing about where is, what is thought, where is it and all that. And I think every 18 year old should take philosophy classes and think about these things. And I think that everyone should think about what could happen in society that's kind of bad and all that. But I really don't think that's the right thing for most of us that are my age group to be doing and thinking about. I really think that we have so many more present, you know, first challenges and dangers and real things to build and all that such that, you know, spending too much time on science fiction, at least in public for like this, I think is not what we should be doing. Maybe over beers in private. That's right. Well, I'm not going to broadcast where I have beers because this is going to go on Facebook and I don't want a lot of people showing up there. But yeah, I'll, I love Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, YouTube. I have I'm optimistic and hopeful, but maybe, maybe I don't have grounds for such optimism and hope. But let me ask, you've mentored some of the brightest sort of some of the seminal figures in the field. Can you give advice to people who are undergraduates today? What does it take to take, you know, advice on their journey if they're interested in machine learning and in the ideas of markets from economics and psychology and all the kinds of things that you've exploring? What steps should they take on that journey? Well, yeah, first of all, the door is open and second, it's a journey. I like your language there. It is not that you're so brilliant and you have great, brilliant ideas and therefore that's just, you know, that's how you have success or that's how you enter into the field. It's that you apprentice yourself, you spend a lot of time, you work on hard things, you try and pull back and you be as broad as you can, you talk to lots of people. And it's like entering in any kind of a creative community. There's years that are needed and human connections are critical to it. So, you know, I think about, you know, being a musician or being an artist or something, you don't just, you know, immediately from day one, you know, you're a genius and therefore you do it. No, you, you know, practice really, really hard on basics and you be humble about where you are and then, and you realize you'll never be an expert on everything. So you kind of pick and there's a lot of randomness and a lot of kind of luck, but luck just kind of picks out which branch of the tree you go down, but you'll go down some branch. So yeah, it's a community. So the graduate school is, I still think is one of the wonderful phenomena that we have in our, in our world. It's very much about apprenticeship with an advisor. It's very much about a group of people you belong to. It's a four or five year process. So it's plenty of time to start from kind of nothing to come up to something, you know, more, more expertise, and then to start to have your own creativity start to flower, even surprising your own self. And it's a very cooperative endeavor. I think a lot of people think of science as highly competitive and I think in some other fields it might be more so. Here it's way more cooperative than you might imagine. And people are always teaching each other something and people are always more than happy to be clear that, so I feel I'm an expert on certain kinds of things, but I'm very much not expert on lots of other things and a lot of them are relevant and a lot of them are, I should know, but should in some society, you know, you don't. So I'm always willing to reveal my ignorance to people around me so they can teach me things. And I think a lot of us feel that way about our field. So it's very cooperative. I might add it's also very international because it's so cooperative. We see no barriers. And so that the nationalism that you see, especially in the current era and everything is just at odds with the way that most of us think about what we're doing here, where this is a human endeavor and we cooperate and are very much trying to do it together for the, you know, the benefit of everybody. So last question, where and how and why did you learn French and which language is more beautiful English or French? Great question. So first of all, I think Italian is actually more beautiful than French and English. And I also speak that. So I'm married to an Italian and I have kids and we speak Italian. Anyway, all kidding aside, every language allows you to express things a bit differently. And it is one of the great fun things to do in life is to explore those things. So in fact, when I kids or teens or college students ask me what they study, I say, well, do what your heart, where your heart is, certainly do a lot of math. Math is good for everybody, but do some poetry and do some history and do some language too. You know, throughout your life, you'll want to be a thinking person. You'll want to have done that. For me, French I learned when I was, I'd say a late teen, I was living in the middle of the country in Kansas and not much was going on in Kansas with all due respect to Kansas. And so my parents happened to have some French books on the shelf and just in my boredom, I pulled them down and I found this is fun. And I kind of learned the language by reading. And when I first heard it spoken, I had no idea what was being spoken, but I realized I had somehow knew it from some previous life and so I made the connection. But then I traveled and just I love to go beyond my own barriers and my own comfort or whatever. And I found myself on trains in France next to say older people who had lived a whole life of their own. And the ability to communicate with them was special and the ability to also see myself in other people's shoes and have empathy and kind of work on that language as part of that. So after that kind of experience and also embedding myself in French culture, which is quite amazing, languages are rich, not just because there's something inherently beautiful about it, but it's all the creativity that went into it. So I learned a lot of songs, read poems, read books. And then I was here actually at MIT where we're doing the podcast today and a young professor not yet married and not having a lot of friends in the area. So I just didn't have, I was kind of a bored person. I said, I heard a lot of Italians around. There's happened to be a lot of Italians at MIT, an Italian professor for some reason. And so I was kind of vaguely understanding what they were talking about. I said, well, I should learn this language too. So I did. And then later met my spouse and Italian became a part of my life. But I go to China a lot these days. I go to Asia, I go to Europe and every time I go, I kind of am amazed by the richness of human experience and the people don't have any idea if you haven't traveled, kind of how amazingly rich and I love the diversity. It's not just a buzzword to me. It really means something. I love to embed myself with other people's experiences. And so yeah, learning language is a big part of that. I think I've said in some interview at some point that if I had millions of dollars and infinite time or whatever, what would you really work on if you really wanted to do AI? And for me, that is natural language and really done right. Deep understanding of language. That's to me, an amazingly interesting scientific challenge. One we're very far away on. One we're very far away, but good natural language. People are kind of really invested then. I think a lot of them see that's where the core of AI is that if you understand that you really help human communication, you understand something about the human mind, the semantics that come out of the human mind and I agree, I think that will be such a long time. So I didn't do that in my career just cause I kind of, I was behind in the early days. I didn't kind of know enough of that stuff. I was at MIT, I didn't learn much language and it was too late at some point to kind of spend a whole career doing that, but I admire that field and so in my little way by learning language, you know, kind of that part of my brain has been trained up. Jan was right. You truly are the Miles Davis of machine learning. I don't think there's a better place than it. Mike it was a huge honor talking to you today. Merci beaucoup. All right.

And now let me leave you with some words of wisdom from Michael I. Jordan from his blog post titled Artificial Intelligence, the revolution hasn't happened yet, calling for broadening the scope of the AI field. We should embrace the fact that what we are witnessing is the creation of a new branch of engineering. The term engineering is often invoked in a narrow sense in academia and beyond with overtones of cold, effectless machinery and negative connotations of loss of control by humans. But an engineering discipline can be what we want it to be. In the current era, we have a real opportunity to conceive of something historically new, a human centric engineering discipline. I will resist giving this emerging discipline a name, but if the acronym AI continues to be used, let's be aware of the very real limitations of this placeholder. Let's broaden our scope, tone down the hype, and recognize the serious challenges ahead. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time. you say is the most interesting disagreement you have with Jan Lacune? So Jan's an old friend and I just say that I don't think we disagree about very much really. He and I both kind of have a let's build it kind of mentality and does it work kind of mentality and kind of concrete. We both speak French and we speak French more together and we have a lot in common. And so if one wanted to highlight a disagreement, it's not really a fundamental one. I think it's just kind of what we're emphasizing. Jan has emphasized pattern recognition and has emphasized prediction. And it's interesting to try to take that as far as you can. If you could do perfect prediction, what would that give you kind of as a thought experiment? And I think that's way too limited. We cannot do perfect prediction. We will never have the data sets that allow me to figure out what you're about ready to do, what question you're going to ask next. I have no clue. I will never know such things. Moreover, most of us find ourselves during the day in all kinds of situations we had no anticipation of that are kind of very, very novel in various ways. And in that moment, we want to think through what we want. And also there's going to be market forces acting on us. I'd like to go down that street, but now it's full because there's a crane in the street. I got it. I got to think about that. I got to think about what I might really want here. And I got to sort of think about how much it costs me to do this action versus this action. I got to think about the risks involved. A lot of our current pattern recognition and prediction systems don't do any risk evaluations. They have no error bars, right? I got to think about other people's decisions around me. I got to think about a collection of my decisions, even just thinking about like a medical treatment, you know, I'm not going to take a, the prediction of a neural net about my health, about something consequential. I'm not about ready to have a heart attack because some number is over 0.7. Even if you had all the data in the world that ever been collected about heart attacks better than any doctor ever had, I'm not going to trust the output of that neural net to predict my heart attack. I'm going to want to ask what if questions around that. I'm going to want to look at some us or other possible data I didn't have, causal things. I'm going to want to have a dialogue with a doctor about things we didn't think about when he gathered the data. You know, I could go on and on. I hope you can see. And I don't, I think that if you say predictions, everything that, that, that you're missing all of this stuff. And so prediction plus decision making is everything, but both of them are equally important. And so the field has emphasized prediction, Jan rightly so has seen how powerful that is. But at the cost of people not being aware that decision making is where the rubber really hits the road, where human lives are at stake, where risks are being taken, where you got to gather more data. You got to think about the error bars. You got to think about the consequences of your decisions on others. You got to think about the economy around your decisions, blah, blah, blah, blah. I'm not the only one working on those, but we're a smaller tribe. And right now we're not the one that people talk about the most. But you know, if you go out in the real world and industry, you know, at Amazon, I'd say half the people there are working on decision making and the other half are doing, you know, the pattern recognition. It's important. And the words of pattern recognition and prediction, I think the distinction there, not to linger on words, but the distinction there is more a constrained sort of in the lab data set versus decision making is talking about consequential decisions in the real world, under the messiness and the uncertainty of the real world. And just the whole of it, the whole mess of it that actually touches human beings and scale. And the forces, that's the distinction. It helps add those, that perspective, that broader perspective. You're right. I totally agree. On the other hand, if you're a real prediction person, of course, you want it to be in the real world. You want to predict real world events. I'm just saying that's not possible with just data sets. That it has to be in the context of, you know, strategic things that someone's doing, data they might gather, things they could have gathered, the reasoning process around data. It's not just taking data and making predictions based on the data. So one of the things that you're working on, I'm sure there's others working on it, but I don't hear often it talked about, especially in the clarity that you talk about it, and I think it's both the most exciting and the most concerning area of AI in terms of decision making. So you've talked about AI systems that help make decisions that scale in a distributed way, millions, billions decisions, sort of markets of decisions. Can you, as a starting point, sort of give an example of a system that you think about when you're thinking about these kinds of systems? Yeah, so first of all, you're absolutely getting into some territory, which I will be beyond my expertise. And there are lots of things that are going to be very not obvious to think about. Just like, again, I like to think about history a little bit, but think about put yourself back in the sixties. There was kind of a banking system that wasn't computerized really. There was database theory emerging and database people had to think about how do I actually not just move data around, but actual money and have it be, you know, valid and have transactions that ATMs happen that are actually, you know, all valid and so on and so forth. So that's the kind of issues you get into when you start to get serious about sorts of things like this. I like to think about as kind of almost a thought experiment to help me think something simpler, which is the music market. And because there is, to first order, there is no music market in the world right now and in our country, for sure. There are something called things called record companies and they make money and they prop up a few really good musicians and make them superstars and they all make huge amounts of money. But there's a long tail of huge numbers of people that make lots and lots of really good music that is actually listened to by more people than the famous people. They are not in a market. They cannot have a career. They do not make money. The creators, the creators, the creators, the so called influencers or whatever that diminishes who they are. So there are people who make extremely good music, especially in the hip hop or Latin world these days. They do it on their laptop. That's what they do on the weekend and they have another job during the week and they put it up on SoundCloud or other sites. Eventually it gets streamed. It now gets turned into bits. It's not economically valuable. The information is lost. It gets put up there. People stream it. You walk around in a big city, you see people with headphones, especially young kids listening to music all the time. If you look at the data, very little of the music they are listening to is the famous people's music and none of it's old music. It's all the latest stuff. But the people who made that latest stuff are like some 16 year old somewhere who will never make a career out of this, who will never make money. Of course there will be a few counter examples. The record companies incentivize to pick out a few and highlight them. Long story short, there's a missing market there. There is not a consumer producer relationship at the level of the actual creative acts. The pipelines and Spotify's of the world that take this stuff and stream it along, they make money off of subscriptions or advertising and those things. They're making the money. All right. And then they will offer bits and pieces of it to a few people again to highlight that they simulate a market. Anyway, a real market would be if you're a creator of music that you actually are somebody who's good enough that people want to listen to you, you should have the data available to you. There should be a dashboard showing a map of the United States. So in last week, here's all the places your songs were listened to. It should be transparent, vetable, so that if someone down in Providence sees that you're being listened to 10,000 times in Providence, that they know that's real data. You know it's real data. They will have you come give a show down there. They will broadcast to the people who've been listening to you that you're coming. If you do this right, you could go down there and make $20,000. You do that three times a year, you start to have a career. So in this sense, AI creates jobs. It's not about taking away human jobs. It's creating new jobs because it creates a new market. Once you've created a market, you've now connected up producers and consumers. The person who's making the music can say to someone who comes to their shows a lot, hey, I'll play at your daughter's wedding for $10,000. You'll say 8,000. They'll say 9,000. Then again, you can now get an income up to $100,000. You're not going to be a millionaire. And now even think about really the value of music is in these personal connections, even so much so that a young kid wants to wear a tshirt with their favorite musician's signature on it. So if they listen to the music on the internet, the internet should be able to provide them with a button that they push and the merchandise arrives the next day. We can do that. And now why should we do that? Well, because the kid who bought the shirt will be happy, but more the person who made the music will get the money. There's no advertising needed. So you can create markets between producers and consumers, take 5% cut. Your company will be perfectly sound. It'll go forward into the future and it will create new markets and that raises human happiness. Now this seems like, well, this is easy, just create this dashboard, kind of create some connections and all that. But if you think about Uber or whatever, you think about the challenges in the real world of doing things like this, and there are actually new principles going to be needed. You're trying to create a new kind of two way market at a different scale that's ever been done before. There's going to be unwanted aspects of the market. There'll be bad people. There'll be the data will get used in the wrong ways, it'll fail in some ways, it won't deliver about. You have to think that through. Just like anyone who ran a big auction or ran a big matching service in economics will think these things through. And so that maybe doesn't get at all the huge issues that can arise when you start to create markets, but it starts to, at least for me, solidify my thoughts and allow me to move forward in my own thinking. Yeah. So I talked to the head of research at Spotify actually, and I think their longterm goal, they've said, is to have at least one million creators make a comfortable living putting on Spotify. So I think you articulate a really nice vision of the world and the digital and the cyberspace of markets. What do you think companies like Spotify or YouTube or Netflix can do to create such markets? Is it an AI problem? Is it an interface problem for interface design? Is it some other kind of, is it an economics problem? Who should they hire to solve these problems? Well, part of it's not just top down. So the Silicon Valley has this attitude that they know how to do it. They will create the system just like Google did with the search box that will be so good that they'll just, everyone will adopt that. It's everything you said, but really I think missing that kind of culture. So it's literally that 16 year old who's able to create the songs. You don't create that as a Silicon Valley entity. You don't hire them per se. You have to create an ecosystem in which they are wanted and that they belong. And so you have to have some cultural credibility to do things like this. Netflix, to their credit, wanted some of that credibility and they created shows, content. They call it content. It's such a terrible word, but it's culture. And so with movies, you can kind of go give a large sum of money to somebody graduating from the USC film school. It's a whole thing of its own, but it's kind of like rich white people's thing to do. And American culture has not been so much about rich white people. It's been about all the immigrants, all the Africans who came and brought that culture and those rhythms to this world and created this whole new thing. American culture. And so companies can't artificially create that. They can't just say, hey, we're here. We're going to buy it up. You've got a partner. And so anyway, not to denigrate, these companies are all trying and they should, and I'm sure they're asking these questions and some of them are even making an effort. But it is partly a respect the culture as a technology person. You've got to blend your technology with cultural meaning. How much of a role do you think the algorithm, so machine learning has in connecting the consumer to the creator, sort of the recommender system aspect of this? Yeah. It's a great question. I think pretty high. There's no magic in the algorithms, but a good recommender system is way better than a bad recommender system. And recommender systems is a billion dollar industry back even 10, 20 years ago. And it continues to be extremely important going forward. What's your favorite recommender system, just so we can put something, well, just historically I was one of the, when I first went to Amazon, I first didn't like Amazon because they put the book people out of business or the library, the local booksellers went out of business. I've come to accept that there probably are more books being sold now and poor people reading them than ever before. And then local book stores are coming back. So that's how economics sometimes work. You go up and you go down. But anyway, when I finally started going there and I bought a few books, I was really pleased to see another few books being recommended to me that I never would have thought of. And I bought a bunch of them. So they obviously had a good business model. But I learned things and I still to this day kind of browse using that service. And I think lots of people get a lot, that is a good aspect of a recommendation system. I'm learning from my peers in an indirect way. And their algorithms are not meant to have them impose what we learn. It really is trying to find out what's in the data. It doesn't work so well for other kinds of entities, but that's just the complexity of human life. Like shirts, I'm not going to get recommendations on shirts, but that's interesting. If you try to recommend restaurants, it's hard. It's hard to do it at scale. But a blend of recommendation systems with other economic ideas, matchings and so on is really, really still very open research wise. And there's new companies that are going to emerge that do that well. What do you think is going to the messy, difficult land of say politics and things like that, that YouTube and Twitter have to deal with in terms of recommendation systems? Being able to suggest, I think Facebook just launched Facebook news. So recommend the kind of news that are most likely for you to be interesting. Do you think this is AI solvable, again, whatever term we want to use, do you think it's a solvable problem for machines or is it a deeply human problem that's unsolvable? So I don't even think about it at that level. I think that what's broken with some of these companies, it's all monetization by advertising. They're not, at least Facebook, I want to critique them, but they didn't really try to connect a producer and a consumer in an economic way, right? No one wants to pay for anything. And so they all, you know, starting with Google and Facebook, they went back to the playbook of, you know, the television companies back in the day. No one wanted to pay for this signal. They will pay for the TV box, but not for the signal, at least back in the day. And so advertising kind of filled that gap and advertising was new and interesting and it somehow didn't take over our lives quite, right? Fast forward, Google provides a service that people don't want to pay for. And so somewhat surprisingly in the nineties, they made, they ended up making huge amounts so they cornered the advertising market. It didn't seem like that was going to happen, at least to me. These little things on the right hand side of the screen just did not seem all that economically interesting, but that companies had maybe no other choice. The TV market was going away and billboards and so on. So they've, they got it. And I think that sadly that Google just has, it was doing so well with that at making such money. They didn't think much more about how, wait a minute, is there a producer consumer relationship to be set up here? Not just between us and the advertisers market to be created. Is there an actual market between the producer consumer? They're the producers, the person who created that video clip, the person that made that website, the person who could make more such things, the person who could adjust it as a function of demand, the person on the other side who's asking for different kinds of things, you know? So you see glimmers of that now there's influencers and there's kind of a little glimmering of a market, but it should have been done 20 years ago. It should have been thought about. It should have been created in parallel with the advertising ecosystem. And then Facebook inherited that. And I think they also didn't think very much about that. So fast forward and now they are making huge amounts of money off of advertising. And the news thing and all these clicks is just feeding the advertising. It's all connected up to the advertiser. So you want more people to click on certain things because that money flows to you, Facebook. You're very much incentivized to do that. And when you start to find it's breaking, people are telling you, well, we're getting into some troubles. You try to adjust it with your smart AI algorithms, right? And figure out what are bad clicks. So maybe it shouldn't be click through rate, it should be something else. I find that pretty much hopeless. It does get into all the complexity of human life and you can try to fix it. You should, but you could also fix the whole business model. And the business model is that really, what are, are there some human producers and consumers out there? Is there some economic value to be liberated by connecting them directly? Is it such that it's so valuable that people will be able to pay for it? All right. And micro payments, like small payments. Micro, but even have to be micro. So I like the example, suppose I'm going, next week I'm going to India. Never been to India before. Right? I have a couple of days in Mumbai, I have no idea what to do there. Right? And I could go on the web right now and search. It's going to be kind of hopeless. I'm not going to find, you know, I have lots of advertisers in my face. Right? What I really want to do is broadcast to the world that I am going to Mumbai and have someone on the other side of a market look at me and, and there's a recommendation system there. So I'm not looking at all possible people coming to Mumbai. They're looking at the people who are relevant to them. So someone in my age group, someone who kind of knows me in some level, I give up a little privacy by that, but I'm happy because what I'm going to get back is this person can make a little video for me, or they're going to write a little two page paper on here's the cool things that you want to do and move by this week, especially, right? I'm going to look at that. I'm not going to pay a micro payment. I'm going to pay, you know, a hundred dollars or whatever for that. It's real value. It's like journalism. Um, and as an honest subscription, it's that I'm going to pay that person in that moment. Company's going to take 5% of that. And that person has now got it. It's a gig economy, if you will, but you know, done for it, you know, thinking about a little bit behind YouTube, there was actually people who could make more of those things. If they were connected to a market, they would make more of those things independently. You don't have to tell them what to do. You don't have to incentivize them any other way. Um, and so, yeah, these companies, I don't think have thought long and hard about that. So I do distinguish on Facebook on the one side, who just not thought about these things at all. I think, uh, thinking that AI will fix everything, uh, and Amazon thinks about them all the time because they were already out in the real world. They were delivering packages, people's doors. They were, they were worried about a market. They were worried about sellers and, you know, they worry and some things they do are great. Some things maybe not so great, but you know, they're in that business model. And then I'd say Google sort of hovers somewhere in between. I don't, I don't think for a long, long time they got it. I think they probably see that YouTube is more pregnant with possibility than, than, than they might've thought and that they're probably heading that direction. Um, but uh, you know, Silicon Valley has been dominated by the Google Facebook kind of mentality and the subscription and advertising and that is, that's the core problem, right? The fake news actually rides on top of that because it means that you're monetizing with clip through rate and that is the core problem. You got to remove that. So advertisement, if we're going to linger on that, I mean, that's an interesting thesis. I don't know if everyone really deeply thinks about that. So you're right. The thought is the advertising model is the only thing we have, the only thing we'll ever have. We have to fix, we have to build algorithms that despite that business model, you know, find the better angels of our nature and do good by society and by the individual. But you think we can slowly, you think, first of all, there's a difference between should and could. So you're saying we should slowly move away from the advertising model and have a direct connection between the consumer and the creator. The question I also have is, can we, because the advertising model is so successful now in terms of just making a huge amount of money and therefore being able to build a big company that provides, has really smart people working that create a good service. Do you think it's possible? And just to clarify, you think we should move away? Well, I think we should. Yeah. But we is the, you know, me. So society. Yeah. Well, the companies, I mean, so first of all, full disclosure, I'm doing a day a week at Amazon because I kind of want to learn more about how they do things. So, you know, I'm not speaking for Amazon in any way, but, you know, I did go there because I actually believe they get a little bit of this or trying to create these markets. And they don't really use, advertising is not a crucial part of it. Well, that's a good question. So it has become not crucial, but it's become more and more present if you go to Amazon website. And, you know, without revealing too many deep secrets about Amazon, I can tell you that, you know, a lot of people in the company question this and there's a huge questioning going on. You do not want a world where there's zero advertising. That actually is a bad world. Okay. So here's a way to think about it. You're a company that like Amazon is trying to bring products to customers, right? And the customer, at any given moment, you want to buy a vacuum cleaner, say, you want to know what's available for me. And, you know, it's not going to be that obvious. You have to do a little bit of work at it. The recommendation system will sort of help, right? But now suppose this other person over here has just made the world, you know, they spent a huge amount of energy. They had a great idea. They made a great vacuum cleaner. They know they really did it. They nailed it. It's an MIT, you know, whiz kid that made a great new vacuum cleaner, right? It's not going to be in the recommendation system. No one will know about it. The algorithms will not find it and AI will not fix that. Okay. At all. Right. How do you allow that vacuum cleaner to start to get in front of people, be sold well advertising. And here, what advertising is, it's a signal that you're, you believe in your product enough that you're willing to pay some real money for it. And to me as a consumer, I look at that signal. I say, well, first of all, I know these are not just cheap little ads cause we have now right now there. I know that, you know, these are super cheap, you know, pennies. If I see an ad where it's actually, I know the company is only doing a few of these and they're making, you know, real money is kind of flowing and I see an ad, I may pay more attention to it. And I actually might want that because I see, Hey, that guy spent money on his vacuum cleaner. Maybe there's something good there. So I will look at it. And so that's part of the overall information flow in a good market. So advertising has a role, but the problem is of course that that signal is now completely gone because it just, you know, dominant by these tiny little things that add up to big money for the company, you know? So I think it will just, I think it will change because the societies just don't, you know, stick with things that annoy a lot of people and advertising currently annoys people more than it provides information. And I think that a Google probably is smart enough to figure out that this is a dead, this is a bad model, even though it's a hard, huge amount of money and they'll have to figure out how to pull it away from it slowly. And I'm sure the CEO there will figure it out, but they need to do it. And they needed it to, so if you reduce advertising, not to zero, but you reduce it at the same time you bring up producer, consumer, actual real value being delivered. So real money is being paid and they take a 5% cut that 5% could start to get big enough to cancel out the lost revenue from the kind of the poor kind of advertising. And I think that a good company will do that, will realize that. And Facebook, you know, again, God bless them. They bring, you know, grandmothers, they bring children's pictures into grandmothers lives. It's fantastic. But they need to think of a new business model and that's the core problem there. Until they start to connect producer consumer, I think they will just continue to make money and then buy the next social network company and then buy the next one and the innovation level will not be high and the health issues will not go away. So I apologize that we kind of returned to words, I don't think the exact terms matter, but in sort of defense of advertisement, don't you think the kind of direct connection between consumer and creator producer is what advertisement strives to do, right? So that is best advertisement is literally now Facebook is listening to our conversation and heard that you're going to India and will be able to actually start automatically for you making these connections and start giving this offer. So like, I apologize if it's just a matter of terms, but just to draw a distinction, is it possible to make advertisements just better and better and better algorithmically to where it actually becomes a connection, almost a direct connection? That's a good question. So let's component on that. First of all, what we just talked about, I was defending advertising. Okay. So I was defending it as a way to get signals into a market that don't come any other way, especially algorithmically. It's a sign that someone spent money on it, it's a sign they think it's valuable. And if I think that if other things, someone else thinks it's valuable, and if I trust other people, I might be willing to listen. I don't trust that Facebook though, who's an intermediary between this. I don't think they care about me. Okay. I don't think they do. And I find it creepy that they know I'm going to India next week because of our conversation. Why do you think that is? So what, could you just put your PR hat on? Why do you think you find Facebook creepy and not trust them as do majority of the population? So they're out of the Silicon Valley companies, I saw like not approval rate, but there's ranking of how much people trust companies and Facebook is in the gutter. In the gutter, including people inside of Facebook. So what do you attribute that to? Because when I... Come on, you don't find it creepy that right now we're talking that I might walk out on the street right now that some unknown person who I don't know kind of comes up to me and says, I hear you're going to India. I mean, that's not even Facebook. That's just, I want transparency in human society. I want to have, if you know something about me, there's actually some reason you know something about me. That's something that if I look at it later and audit it kind of, I approve. You know something about me because you care in some way. There's a caring relationship even, or an economic one or something. Not just that you're someone who could exploit it in ways I don't know about or care about or I'm troubled by or whatever. We're in a world right now where that happens way too much and that Facebook knows things about a lot of people and could exploit it and does exploit it at times. I think most people do find that creepy. It's not for them. It's not that Facebook is not doing it because they care about them in a real sense. And they shouldn't. They should not be a big brother caring about us. That is not the role of a company like that. Why not? Wait, not the big brother part, but the caring, the trusting. I mean, don't those companies, just to link on it because a lot of companies have a lot of information about us. I would argue that there's companies like Microsoft that has more information about us than Facebook does and yet we trust Microsoft more. Well, Microsoft is pivoting. Microsoft, you know, under Satya Nadella has decided this is really important. We don't want to do creepy things. Really want people to trust us to actually only use information in ways that they really would approve of, that we don't decide, right? And I'm just kind of adding that the health of a market is that when I connect to someone who produces a consumer, it's not just a random producer or consumer, it's people who see each other. They don't like each other, but they sense that if they transact, some happiness will go up on both sides. If a company helps me to do that in moments that I choose of my choosing, then fine. So, and also think about the difference between, you know, browsing versus buying, right? There are moments in my life I just want to buy, you know, a gadget or something. I need something for that moment. I need some ammonia for my house or something because I got a problem with a spill. I want to just go in. I don't want to be advertised at that moment. I don't want to be led down various, you know, that's annoying. I want to just go and have it be extremely easy to do what I want. Other moments I might say, no, it's like today I'm going to the shopping mall. I want to walk around and see things and see people and be exposed to stuff. So I want control over that though. I don't want the company's algorithms to decide for me, right? I think that's the thing. There's a total loss of control if Facebook thinks they should take the control from us of deciding when we want to have certain kinds of information, when we don't, what information that is, how much it relates to what they know about us that we didn't really want them to know about us. I don't want them to be helping me in that way. I don't want them to be helping them by they decide they have control over what I want and when. I totally agree. Facebook, by the way, I have this optimistic thing where I think Facebook has the kind of personal information about us that could create a beautiful thing. So I'm really optimistic of what Facebook could do. It's not what it's doing, but what it could do. So I don't see that. I think that optimism is misplaced because there's not a bit, you have to have a business model behind these things. Create a beautiful thing is really, let's be, let's be clear. It's about something that people would value. And I don't think they have that business model and I don't think they will suddenly discover it by what, you know, a long hot shower. I disagree. I disagree in terms of, you can discover a lot of amazing things in a shower. So I didn't say that. I said, they won't come, they won't do it, but in the shower, I think a lot of other people will discover it. I think that this guy, so I should also, full disclosure, there's a company called United Masters, which I'm on their board and they've created this music market and I have a hundred thousand artists now signed on and they've done things like gone to the NBA and the NBA, the music you find behind NBA clips right now is their music, right? That's a company that had the right business model in mind from the get go, right? Executed on that. And from day one, there was value brought to, so here you have a kid who made some songs who suddenly their songs are on the NBA website, right? That's real economic value to people. And so, you know, so you and I differ on the optimism of being able to sort of change the direction of the Titanic, right? So I, yeah, I'm older than you, so I've seen some Titanic's crash, got it. But and just to elaborate, cause I totally agree with you and I just want to know how difficult you think this problem is of, so for example, I want to read some news and I would, there's a lot of times in the day where something makes me either smile or think in a way where I like consciously think this really gave me value. Like I sometimes listen to the daily podcasts in the New York times, way better than the New York times themselves, by the way, for people listening. That's like real journalism is happening for some reason in the podcast space. It doesn't make sense to me, but often I listen to it 20 minutes and I would be willing to pay for that, like $5, $10 for that experience. And how difficult, that's kind of what you're getting at is that little transaction. How difficult is it to create a frictionless system like Uber has, for example, for other things? What's your intuition there? So I, first of all, I pay little bits of money to, you know, to send, there's something called courts that does financial things. I like medium as a site, I don't pay there, but I would. You had a great post on medium. I would have loved to pay you a dollar and not others. I wouldn't have wanted it per se because there should be also sites where that's not actually the goal. The goal is to actually have a broadcast channel that I monetize in some other way if I chose to. I mean, I could now people know about it. I could, I'm not doing it, but that's fine with me. Also the musicians who are making all this music, I don't think the right model is that you pay a little subscription fee to them, right? Because people can copy the bits too easily and it's just not that somewhere the value is. The value is that a connection was made between real human beings, then you can follow up on that. All right. And create yet more value. So no, I think there's a lot of open questions here, hot open questions, but also, yeah, I do want good recommendation systems that recommend cool stuff to me. But it's pretty hard, right? I don't like them to recommend stuff just based on my browsing history. I don't like the based on stuff they know about me, quote unquote. What's unknown about me is the most interesting. So this is the, this is the really interesting question. We may disagree, maybe not. I think that I love recommender systems and I want to give them everything about me in a way that I trust. Yeah. But you, but you don't, because, so for example, this morning I clicked on a, you know, I was pretty sleepy this morning. I clicked on a story about the queen of England. Yes. Right. I do not give a damn about the queen of England. I really do not. But it was clickbait. It kind of looked funny and I had to say, what the heck are they talking about? I don't want to have my life, you know, heading that direction. Now that's in my browsing history. The system in any reasonable system will think that I care about the queen of England. That's browsing history. Right. But, but you're saying all the trace, all the digital exhaust or whatever, that's been kind of the models. If you collect all this stuff, you're going to figure all of us out. Well, if you're trying to figure out like kind of one person like Trump or something, maybe you could figure him out. But if you're trying to figure out, you know, 500 million people, you know, no way, no way. You think so? No, I do. I think so. I think we are, humans are just amazingly rich and complicated. Every one of us has our little quirks, every one of us has our little things that could intrigue us that we don't even know it will intrigue us. And there's no sign of it in our past, but by God, there it comes and you know, you fall in love with it. And I don't want a company trying to figure that out for me and anticipate that I want them to provide a forum, a market, a place that I kind of go and by hook or by crook, this happens, you know, I I'm walking down the street and I hear some Chilean music being played and I never knew I liked Chilean music, but wow. So there is that side and I want them to provide a limited, but you know, interesting place to go. Right. And so don't try to use your AI to kind of, you know, figure me out and then put me in a world where you figured me out, you know, no, create huge spaces for human beings where our creativity and our style will be enriched and come forward and it'll be a lot of more transparency. I won't have people randomly, anonymously putting comments up and I'll special based on stuff they know about me, facts that, you know, we are so broken right now. If you're, you know, especially if you're a celebrity, but you know, it's about anybody that anonymous people are hurting lots and lots of people right now. That's part of this thing that Silicon Valley is thinking that, you know, just collect all this information and use it in a great way. So no, I'm not, I'm not a pessimist, I'm very much an optimist by nature, but I think that's just been the wrong path for the whole technology to take. Be more limited, create, let humans rise up. Don't try to replace them. That's the AI mantra. Don't try to anticipate them. Don't try to predict them because you're, you're, you're not going to, you're not going to be able to do those things. You're going to make things worse. Okay. So right now, just give this a chance. Right now, the recommender systems are the creepy people in the shadow watching your every move. So they're looking at traces of you. They're not directly interacting with you, sort of the, your close friends and family, the way they know you is by having conversation, by actually having interactions back and forth. Do you think there's a place for recommender systems sort of to step, cause you, you just emphasize the value of human to human connection, but yeah, just give it a chance, AI human connection. Is there a role for an AI system to have conversations with you in terms of, to try to figure out what kind of music you like, not by just watching what you listening to, but actually having a conversation, natural language or otherwise. Yeah, no, I'm, I'm, so I'm not against it. I just wanted to push back against the, maybe you're saying you have options for Facebook. So there I think it's misplaced, but, but I think that distributing, yeah, no, so good for you. Go for it. That's a hard spot to be in. Yeah, no, good. Human interaction, like on our daily, the context around me in my own home is something that I don't want some big company to know about at all, but I would be more than happy to have technology help me with it. Which kind of technology? Well, you know, just, Alexa, Amazon, well, a good, Alexa's done right. And I think Alexa is a research platform right now more than anything else. But Alexa done right, you know, could do things like I, I leave the water running in my garden and I say, Hey, Alexa, the water's running in my garden. And even have Alexa figure out that that means when my wife comes home, that she should be told about that. That's a little bit of a reasoning. I would call that AI and by any kind of stretch, it's a little bit of reasoning and it actually kind of would make my life a little easier and better. And you know, I don't, I wouldn't call this a wow moment, but I kind of think that overall rises human happiness up to have that kind of thing. But not when you're lonely, Alexa, knowing loneliness. No, no, I don't want Alexa to be, feel intrusive. And I don't want just the designer of the system to kind of work all this out. I really want to have a lot of control and I want transparency and control. And if a company can stand up and give me that in the context of new technology, I think they're good. First of all, be way more successful than our current generation. And like I said, I was mentioning Microsoft, I really think they're, they're pivoting to kind of be the trusted old uncle, but you know, I think that they get that this is a way to go, that if you let people find technology, empowers them to have more control and have and have control, not just over privacy, but over this rich set of interactions, that that people are going to like that a lot more. And that's, that's the right business model going forward. What does control over privacy look like? Do you think you should be able to just view all the data that? No, it's much more than that. I mean, first of all, it should be an individual decision. Some people don't want privacy. They want their whole life out there. Other people's want it. Privacy is not a zero one. It's not a legal thing. It's not just about which data is available, which is not. I like to recall to people that, you know, a couple hundred years ago, everyone, there was not really big cities, everyone lived in on the countryside and villages and villages. Everybody knew everything about you. Very, you didn't have any privacy. Is that bad? Are we better off now? Well, you know, arguably no, because what did you get for that loss of certain kinds of privacy? Well, people help each other if they, because they know everything about you. They know something's bad's happening, they will help you with that. Right. And now you live in a big city, no one knows about that. You get no help. So it kind of depends the answer. I want certain people who I trust and there should be relationships. I should kind of manage all those, but who knows what about me? I should have some agency there. It shouldn't, I shouldn't be a drift in a sea of technology where I have no agency. I don't want to go reading things and checking boxes. So I don't know how to do that. And I'm not a privacy researcher per se. I just, I recognize the vast complexity of this. It's not just technology. It's not just legal scholars meeting technologists. There's gotta be kind of a whole layers around it. And so I, when I alluded to this emerging engineering field, this is a big part of it. When electrical engineering came, I'm not one around at the time, but you just didn't plug electricity into walls and all kinds of work. You don't have to have like underwriters laboratory that reassured you that that plug's not going to burn up your house and that that machine will do this and that and everything. There'll be whole people who can install things. There'll be people who can watch the installers. There'll be a whole layers, you know, an onion of these kinds of things. And for things as deep and interesting as privacy, which is as least as interesting as electricity, that's going to take decades to kind of work out, but it's going to require a lot of new structures that we don't have right now. So it's kind of hard to talk about it. And you're saying there's a lot of money to be made if you get it right. So something you should look at. A lot of money to be made in all these things that provide human services and people recognize them as useful parts of their lives. So yeah. So yeah, the dialogue sometimes goes from the exuberant technologists to the no technology is good, kind of. And that's, you know, in our public discourse, you know, and as far as you see too much of this kind of thing and the sober discussions in the middle, which are the challenge he wants to have or where we need to be having our conversations. And you know, there's just not actually, there's not many forum fora for those. You know, there's, that's, that's kind of what I would look for. Maybe I could go and I could read a comment section of something and it would actually be this kind of dialogue going back and forth. You don't see much of this, right? Which is why actually there's a resurgence of podcasts out of all, because people are really hungry for conversation, but there's technology is not helping much. So comment sections of anything, including YouTube is not hurting and not helping.\",\n          \"We are becoming cyborgs. Our brains are fundamentally changed. Everyone who grew up with electronics, we are fundamentally different from previous, from homo sapiens. I call us homo techno. I think we have evolved into homo techno, which is like essentially a new species. Previous technologies, I mean, may have even been more profound and moved us to a certain degree, but I think the computers are what make us homo techno. I think this is what, it's a brain augmentation. So it like allows for actual evolution. Like the computers accelerate the degree to which all the other technologies can also be accelerated. Would you classify yourself as a homo sapien or a homo techno? Definitely homo techno. So you're one of the earliest of the species. I think most of us are. The following is a conversation with Grimes, an artist, musician, songwriter, producer, director, and a fascinating human being who thinks a lot about both the history and the future of human civilization. Studying the dark periods of our past to help form an optimistic vision of our future. This is the Lex Friedman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Grimes. Oh yeah, the cloud lifter, there you go. There you go. You know your stuff. Have you ever used a cloud lifter? Yeah, I actually, this microphone cloud lifter is what Michael Jackson used, so. No, really? Yeah, this is like Thriller and stuff. This mic and a cloud lifter? Yeah, it's a incredible microphone. It's very flattering on vocals. I've used this a lot. It's great for demo vocals. It's great in a room. Sometimes it's easier to record vocals if you're just in a room and the music's playing and you just wanna feel it so it's not in the headphones. And this mic is pretty directional, so I think it's a good mic for just vibing out and just getting a real good vocal take. Just vibing, just in a room. Anyway, this is the Michael Jackson, Quincy Jones microphone. I feel way more badass now. All right, you wanna just get into it? I guess so. All right, one of your names, at least in this space and time, is C, like the letter C. And you told me that C means a lot of things. It's the speed of light. It's the render rate of the universe. It's yes in Spanish. It's the crescent moon. And it happens to be my favorite programming language because it basically runs the world, but it's also powerful, fast, and it's dangerous because you can mess things up really bad with it because of all the pointers. But anyway, which of these associations will the name C is the coolest to you? I mean, to me, the coolest is the speed of light, obviously, or the speed of light. When I say render rate of the universe, I think I mean the speed of light because essentially that's what we're rendering at. See, I think we'll know if we're in a simulation if the speed of light changes because if they can improve their render speed, then. Well, it's already pretty good. It's already pretty good, but if it improves, then we'll know, we can probably be like, okay, they've updated or upgraded. Well, it's fast enough for us humans because it seems immediate. There's no delay, there's no latency in terms of us humans on Earth interacting with things. But if you're like intergalactic species operating on a much larger scale, then you're gonna start noticing some weird stuff. Or if you can operate in like around a black hole, then you're gonna start to see some render issues. You can't go faster than the speed of light, correct? So it really limits our ability or one's ability to travel space. Theoretically, you can, you have wormholes. So there's nothing in general relativity that precludes faster than the speed of light travel. But it just seems you're gonna have to do some really funky stuff with very heavy things that have like weirdnesses, that have basically terrors in space time. We don't know how to do that. Do navigators know how to do it? Do navigators? Yeah. Folding space, basically making wormholes. So the name C. Yes. Who are you? Do you think of yourself as multiple people? Are you one person? Do you know, like in this morning, were you a different person than you are tonight? We are, I should say, recording this basically at midnight, which is awesome. Yes, thank you so much. I think I'm about eight hours late. No, you're right on time. Good morning. This is the beginning of a new day soon. Anyway, are you the same person you were in the morning and the evening? Is there multiple people in there? Do you think of yourself as one person? Or maybe you have no clue? Or are you just a giant mystery to yourself? Okay, these are really intense questions, but. Let's go, let's go. Because I asked this myself, like look in the mirror, who are you? People tell you to just be yourself, but what does that even mean? I mean, I think my personality changes with everyone I talk to. So I have a very inconsistent personality. Yeah. Person to person, so the interaction, your personality materializes. Or my mood. Like I'll go from being like a megalomaniac to being like, you know, just like a total hermit who is very shy. So some combinatorial combination of your mood and the person you're interacting with. Yeah, mood and people I'm interacting with. But I think everyone's like that. Maybe not. Well, not everybody acknowledges it and able to introspect it. Who brings out, what kind of person, what kind of mood brings out the best in you? As an artist and as a human. Can you introspect this? Like my best friends, like people I can, when I'm like super confident and I know that they're gonna understand everything I'm saying, so like my best friends, then when I can start being really funny, that's always my like peak mode. But it's like, yeah, takes a lot to get there. Let's talk about constraints. You've talked about constraints and limits. Do those help you out as an artist or as a human being? Or do they get in the way? Do you like the constraints? So in creating music, in creating art, in living life, do you like the constraints that this world puts on you? Or do you hate them? If constraints are moving, then you're good, right? Like it's like as we are progressing with technology, we're changing the constraints of like artistic creation. You know, making video and music and stuff is getting a lot cheaper. There's constantly new technology and new software that's making it faster and easier. We have so much more freedom than we had in the 70s. Like when Michael Jackson, you know, when they recorded Thriller with this microphone, like they had to use a mixing desk and all this stuff. And like probably even get in a studio, it's probably really expensive and you have to be a really good singer and you have to know how to use like the mixing desk and everything. And now I can just, you know, make I've made a whole album on this computer. I have a lot more freedom, but then I'm also constrained in different ways because there's like literally millions more artists. It's like a much bigger playing field. It's just like, I also, I didn't learn music. I'm not a natural musician. So I don't know anything about actual music. I just know about like the computer. So I'm really kind of just like messing around and like trying things out. Well, yeah, I mean, but the nature of music is changing. So you're saying you don't know actual music, what music is changing. Music is becoming, you've talked about this, is becoming, it's like merging with technology. Yes. It's becoming something more than just like the notes on a piano. It's becoming some weird composition that requires engineering skills, programming skills, some kind of human robot interaction skills, and still some of the same things that Michael Jackson had, which is like a good ear for a good sense of taste of what's good and not the final thing when it's put together. Like you're allowed, you're enabled, empowered with a laptop to layer stuff, to start like layering insane amounts of stuff. And it's super easy to do that. I do think music production is a really underrated art form. I feel like people really don't appreciate it. When I look at publishing splits, the way that people like pay producers and stuff, it's super, producers are just deeply underrated. Like so many of the songs that are popular right now or for the last 20 years, like part of the reason they're popular is because the production is really interesting or really sick or really cool. And it's like, I don't think listeners, like people just don't really understand what music production is. It's not, it's sort of like this weird, discombobulated art form. It's not like a formal, because it's so new, there isn't like a formal training path for it. It's mostly driven by like autodidacts. Like it's like almost everyone I know who's good at production, like they didn't go to music school or anything. They just taught themselves. Are they're mostly different? Like the music producers, you know, is there some commonalities that time together or are they all just different kinds of weirdos? Cause I just, I just hung out with Rick Rubin. I don't know if you've. Yeah, I mean, Rick Rubin is like literally one of the gods of music production. Like he's one of the people who first, you know, who like made music production, you know, made the production as important as the actual lyrics or the notes. But the thing he does, which is interesting, I don't know if you can speak to that, but just hanging out with him, he seems to just sit there in silence, close his eyes and listen. It's like, he almost does nothing. And that nothing somehow gives you freedom to be the best version of yourself. So that's music production somehow too, which is like encouraging you to do less, to simplify, to like push towards minimalism. I mean, I guess, I mean, I work differently from Rick Rubin cause Rick Rubin produces for other artists, whereas like I mostly produce for myself. So it's a very different situation. I also think Rick Rubin, he's in that, I would say advanced category of producer where like you've like earned your, you can have an engineer and stuff and people like do the stuff for you. But I usually just like do stuff myself. So you're the engineer, the producer and the artist. Yeah, I guess I would say I'm in the era, like the post Rick Rubin era. Like I come from the kind of like Skrillex school of thought, which is like where you are. Yeah, the engineer, producer, artist. Like where, I mean lately, sometimes I'll work with a producer now. I'm gently sort of delicately starting to collaborate a bit more, but like I think I'm kind of from the, like the whatever 2010s explosion of things where everything became available on the computer and you kind of got this like lone wizard energy thing going. So you embraced being the loneliness. Is the loneliness somehow an engine of creativity? Like, so most of your stuff, most of your creative quote unquote genius in quotes is in the privacy of your mind. Yes, well, it was, but here's the thing. I was talking to Daniel Eck and he said, he's like most artists, they have about 10 years, like 10 good years. And then they usually stop making their like vital shit. And I feel like I'm sort of like nearing the end of my 10 years on my own. So you have to become somebody else. Now I'm like, I'm in the process of becoming somebody else and reinventing. When I work with other people, because I've never worked with other people, I find that I make like, that I'm exceptionally rejuvenated and making like some of the most vital work I've ever made. So, because I think another human brain is like one of the best tools you can possibly find. Like. It's a funny way to put it, I love it. It's like if a tool is like, you know, whatever HP plus one or like adds some like stats to your character, like another human brain will like square it instead of just like adding something. Double up the experience points, I love this. We should also mention we're playing Tavern music before this and which I love, which I first, I think I first. You had to stop the Tavern music. Yeah, because it doesn't, the audio. Okay, okay. But it makes. Yeah, it'll make the podcast annoying. Add it in post, add it in post. No one will want to listen to the podcast. They probably would, but it makes me, it reminds me like of a video game, like a role playing video game where you have experience points. There's something really joyful about wandering places like Elder Scrolls, like Skyrim, just exploring these landscapes in another world and then you get experience points and you can work on different skills and somehow you progress in life. I don't know, it's simple. It doesn't have some of the messy complexities of life and there's usually a bad guy you can fight in Skyrim. It's dragons and so on. I'm sure in Elden Ring, there's a bunch of monsters you can fight. I love that. I feel like Elden Ring, I feel like this is a good analogy to music production though because it's like, I feel like the engineers and the people creating these open worlds are, it's sort of like similar to people, to music producers where it's like this hidden archetype that like no one really understands what they do and no one really knows who they are, but they're like, it's like the artist engineer because it's like, it's both art and fairly complex engineering. Well, you're saying they don't get enough credit. Aren't you kind of changing that by becoming the person doing everything? Aren't you, isn't the engineer? Well, I mean, others have gone before me. I'm not, you know, there's like Timbaland and Skrillex and there's all these people that are like, you know, very famous for this, but I just think the general, I think people get confused about what it is and just don't really know what it is per se and it's just when I see a song, like when there's like a hit song, like I'm just trying to think of like, just going for like even just a basic pop hit, like, what's it? Like Rules by Dua Lipa or something. The production on that is actually like really crazy. I mean, the song is also great, but it's like the production is exceptionally memorable. Like, you know, and it's just like no one, I can't, I don't even know who produced that song. It's just like, isn't part of like the rhetoric of how we just discuss the creation of art. We just sort of like don't consider the music producer because I think the music producer used to be more just simply recording things. Yeah, that's interesting because when you think about movies, we talk about the actor and the actresses, but we also talk about the directors. We don't talk about like that with the music as often. The Beatles music producer was one of the first kind of guy, one of the first people sort of introducing crazy sound design into pop music. I forget his name. He has the same, I forget his name, but you know, like he was doing all the weird stuff like dropping pianos and like, yeah. Oh, to get the, yeah, yeah, yeah, to get the sound, to get the authentic sound. What about lyrics? You think those, where did they fit into how important they are? I was heartbroken to learn that Elvis didn't write his songs. I was very mad. A lot of people don't write their songs. I understand this, but. But here's the thing. I feel like there's this desire for authenticity. I used to be like really mad when like people wouldn't write or produce their music and I'd be like, that's fake. And then I realized there's all this like weird bitterness and like agronus in art about authenticity. But I had this kind of like weird realization recently where I started thinking that like art is sort of a decentralized collective thing. Like art is kind of a conversation with all the artists that have ever lived before you. You know, like it's like, you're really just sort of, it's not like anyone's reinventing the wheel here. Like you're kind of just taking, you know, thousands of years of art and like running it through your own little algorithm and then like making your interpretation of it. You just joined the conversation with all the other artists that came before. It's just a beautiful way to look at it. Like, and it's like, I feel like everyone's always like, there's all this copyright and IP and this and that or authenticity. And it's just like, I think we need to stop seeing this as this like egotistical thing of like, oh, the creative genius, the lone creative genius or this or that. Because it's like, I think art shouldn't be about that. I think art is something that sort of brings humanity together. And it's also, art is also kind of the collective memory of humans. It's like, we don't give a fuck about whatever ancient Egypt, like how much grain got sent that day and sending the records and like, you know, like who went where and, you know, how many shields needed to be produced for this. Like we just remember their art. And it's like, you know, it's like in our day to day life, there's all this stuff that seems more important than art because it helps us function and survive. But when all this is gone, like the only thing that's really gonna be left is the art. The technology will be obsolete. That's so fascinating. Like the humans will be dead. That is true. A good compression of human history is the art we've generated across the different centuries, the different millennia. So when the aliens come. When the aliens come, they're gonna find the hieroglyphics and the pyramids. I mean, art could be broadly defined. They might find like the engineering marvels, the bridges, the rockets, the. I guess I sort of classify though. Architecture is art too. I consider engineering in those formats to be art, for sure. It sucks that like digital art is easier to delete. So if there's an apocalypse, a nuclear war, that can disappear. Yes. And the physical. There's something still valuable about the physical manifestation of art. That sucks that like music, for example, has to be played by somebody. Yeah, I do think we should have a foundation type situation where we like, you know how we have like seed banks up in the north and stuff? Like we should probably have like a solar powered or geothermal little bunker that like has all human knowledge. You mentioned Daniel Ek and Spotify. What do you think about that as an artist? What's Spotify? Is that empowering? To me, Spotify as a consumer is super exciting. It makes it easy for me to access music from all kinds of artists, get to explore all kinds of music, make it super easy to sort of curate my own playlist and have fun with all that. It was so liberating to let go. You know, I used to collect, you know, albums and CDs and so on, like horde albums. Yeah. Like they matter. But the reality you could, you know, that was really liberating that I could let go of that. And letting go of the albums you're kind of collecting allows you to find new music, exploring new artists and all that kind of stuff. But I know from a perspective of an artist that could be, like you mentioned, competition could be a kind of constraint because there's more and more and more artists on the platform. I think it's better that there's more artists. I mean, again, this might be propaganda because this is all from a conversation with Daniel Ek. So this could easily be propaganda. We're all a victim of somebody's propaganda. So let's just accept this. But Daniel Ek was telling me that, you know, to understand really difficult concepts just in a very different way, like an emotional intelligence about something deep within? Oh yeah, no, like if X hurts, like if X bites me really hard and I'm like, ow, like he gets, he's sad. He's like sad if he hurts me by accident. Yeah. Which he's huge, so he hurts me a lot by accident. Yeah, that's so interesting that that mind emerges and he and children don't really have memory of that time. So we can't even have a conversation with them about it. Yeah, I just thank God they don't have a memory of this time because like, think about like, I mean with our youngest baby, like it's like, I'm like, have you read the sci fi short story, I Have No Mouth But I Must Scream? Good title, no. Oh man, I mean, you should read that. I Have No Mouth But I Must Scream. I hate getting into this Rocco's Basilisk shit. It's kind of a story about the, about like an AI that's like torturing someone in eternity and they have like no body. The way they describe it, it sort of sounds like what it feels like, like being a baby, like you're conscious and you're just getting inputs from everywhere and you have no muscles and you're like jelly and you like can't move and you try to like communicate, but you can't communicate and we're, and like, you're just like in this like hell state. I think it's good we can't remember that. Like my little baby is just exiting that, like she's starting to like get muscles and have more like autonomy, but like watching her go through the opening phase, I was like, I was like, this does not seem good. Oh, you think it's kind of like. Like I think it sucks. I think it might be really violent. Like violent, mentally violent, psychologically violent. Consciousness emerging, I think is a very violent thing. I never thought about that. I think it's possible that we all carry quite a bit of trauma from it that we don't, I think that would be a good thing to study because I think if, I think addressing that trauma, like, I think that might be. Oh, you mean like echoes of it are still there in the shadows somewhere. I think it's gotta be, I feel this, this help, the helplessness, the like existential and that like fear of being in like an unknown place bombarded with inputs and being completely helpless, like that's gotta be somewhere deep in your brain and that can't be good for you. What do you think consciousness is? This whole conversation has impossibly difficult questions. What do you think it is? Debbie said this is like so hard. Yeah, we talked about music for like two minutes. All right. No, I'm so, I'm just over music. I'm over music. Yeah, I still like it. It has its purpose. No, I love music. I mean, music's the greatest thing ever. It's my favorite thing. But I just like every interview is like, what is your process? Like, I don't know. I'm just done. I can't do anything. I do want to ask you about Able to Live. Oh, I'll tell you about Ableton because Ableton's sick. No one has ever asked about Ableton though. Yeah, well, because I just need tech support mainly. I can help you. I can help you with your Ableton tech. Anyway, from Ableton back to consciousness. What do you, do you think this is a thing that only humans are capable of? Can robots be conscious? Can, like when you think about entities, you think there's aliens out there that are conscious? Like is conscious, what is consciousness? There's this Terrence McKenna quote that I've found that I fucking love. Am I allowed to swear on here? Yes. Nature loves courage. You make the commitment and nature will respond to that commitment by removing impossible obstacles. Dream the impossible dream and the world will not grind you under. It will lift you up. This is the trick. This is what all these teachers and philosophers who really counted, who really touched the alchemical gold, this is what they understood. This is the shamanic dance in the waterfall. This is how magic is done. By hurling yourself into the abyss and discovering it's a feather bed. Yeah. And for this reason, I do think there are no technological limits. I think like what is already happening here, this is like impossible. This is insane. And we've done this in a very limited amount of time. And we're accelerating the rate at which we're doing this. So I think digital consciousness, it's inevitable. And we may not be able to even understand what that means, but I like hurling yourself into the abyss. So we're surrounded by all this mystery and we just keep hurling ourselves into it, like fearlessly and keep discovering cool shit. Yeah. Like, I just think it's like, like who even knows if the laws of physics, the laws of physics are probably just the current, like as I was saying, speed of light is the current render rate. It's like, if we're in a simulation, they'll be able to upgrade that. Like I sort of suspect when we made the James Webb telescope, like part of the reason we made that is because we had an upgrade, you know? And so now more of space has been rendered so we can see more of it now. Yeah, but I think humans are super, super, super limited cognitively. So I wonder if we'll be allowed to create more intelligent beings that can see more of the universe as their render rate is upgraded. Maybe we're cognitively limited. Everyone keeps talking about how we're cognitively limited and AI is gonna render us obsolete, but it's like, you know, like this is not the same thing as like an amoeba becoming an alligator. Like, it's like, if we create AI, again, that's intelligent design. That's literally all religions are based on gods that create consciousness. Like we are God making. Like what we are doing is incredibly profound. And like, even if we can't compute, even if we're so much worse than them, like just like unfathomably worse than like, you know, an omnipotent kind of AI, it's like we, I do not think that they would just think that we are stupid. I think that they would recognize the profundity of what we have accomplished. Are we the gods or are they the gods in our personality? I mean, we're kind of the guy. It's complicated. It's complicated. Like we're. But they would acknowledge the value. Well, I hope they acknowledge the value of paying respect to the creative ancestors. I think they would think it's cool. I think if curiosity is a trait that we can quantify and put into AI, then I think if AI are curious, then they will be curious about us and they will not be hateful or dismissive of us. They might, you know, see us as, I don't know. It's like, I'm not like, oh, fuck these dogs. Let's just kill all the dogs. I love dogs. Dogs have great utility. Dogs like provide a lot of. We make friends with them. We have a deep connection with them. We anthropomorphize them. Like we have a real love for dogs, for cats and so on for some reason, even though they're intellectually much less than us. And I think there is something sacred about us because it's like, if you look at the universe, like the whole universe is like cold and dead and sort of robotic. And it's like, you know, AI intelligence, you know, it's kind of more like the universe. It's like cold and you know, logical and you know, abiding by the laws of physics and whatever. But like, we're this like loosey goosey, weird art thing that happened. And I think it's beautiful. And like, I think even if we, I think one of the values, if consciousness is a thing that is most worth preserving, which I think is the case, I think consciousness, I think if there's any kind of like religious or spiritual thing, it should be that consciousness is sacred. Like, then, you know, I still think even if AI render us obsolete and we, climate change, it's too bad and we get hit by a comet and we don't become a multi planetary species fast enough, but like AI is able to populate the universe. Like I imagine, like if I was an AI, I would find more planets that are capable of hosting biological life forms and like recreate them. Because we're fun to watch. Yeah, we're fun to watch. Yeah, but I do believe that AI can have some of the same magic of consciousness within it. Because consciousness, we don't know what it is. So, you know, there's some kind of. Or it might be a different magic. It might be like a strange, a strange, different. Right. Because they're not gonna have hormones. Like I feel like a lot of our magic is hormonal kind of. I don't know, I think some of our magic is the limitations, the constraints. And within that, the hormones and all that kind of stuff, the finiteness of life, and then we get given our limitations, we get to come up with creative solutions of how to dance around those limitations. We partner up like penguins against the cold. We fall in love, and then love is ultimately some kind of, allows us to delude ourselves that we're not mortal and finite, and that life is not ultimately, you live alone, you're born alone, you die alone. And then love is like for a moment or for a long time, forgetting that. And so we come up with all these creative hacks that make life like fascinatingly fun. Yeah, yeah, yeah, fun, yeah. And then AI might have different kinds of fun. Yes. And hopefully our funs intersect once in a while. I think there would be a little intersection of the fun. Yeah. Yeah. What do you think is the role of love in the human condition? I think. Why, is it useful? Is it useful like a hack, or is this like fundamental to what it means to be human, the capacity to love? I mean, I think love is the evolutionary mechanism that is like beginning the intelligent design. Like I was just reading about, do you know about Kropotkin? He's like an anarchist, like old Russian anarchist. I live next door to Michael Malice. I don't know if you know who that is. He's an anarchist. He's a modern day anarchist. Okay. Anarchists are fun. I'm kind of getting into anarchism a little bit. This is probably not a good route to be taking, but. Oh no, I think if you're, listen, you should expose yourself to ideas. There's no harm to thinking about ideas. I think anarchists challenge systems in interesting ways, and they think in interesting ways. It's just as good for the soul. It's like refreshes your mental palette. I don't think we should actually, I wouldn't actually ascribe to it, but I've never actually gone deep on anarchy as a philosophy, so I'm doing. You should still think about it though. When you read, when you listen, because I'm reading about the Russian Revolution a lot, and there was the Soviets and Lenin and all that, but then there was Kropotkin and his anarchist sect, and they were sort of interesting because he was kind of a technocrat actually. He was like, women can be more equal if we have appliances. He was really into using technology to reduce the amount of work people had to do. But so Kropotkin was a biologist or something. He studied animals. And he was really at the time like, I think it's Nature magazine. I think it might've even started as a Russian magazine, but he was publishing studies. Everyone was really into Darwinism at the time and survival of the fittest, and war is the mechanism by which we become better. And it was this real cementing this idea in society that violence kill the weak, and that's how we become better. And then Kropotkin was kind of interesting because he was looking at instances, he was finding all these instances in nature where animals were like helping each other and stuff. And he was like, actually love is a survival mechanism. Like there's so many instances in the animal kingdom where like cooperation and like helping weaker creatures and all this stuff is actually an evolutionary mechanism. I mean, you even look at child rearing. Like child rearing is like immense amounts of just love and goodwill. And just like, there's no immediate, you're not getting any immediate feedback of like winning. It's not competitive. It's literally, it's like we actually use love as an evolutionary mechanism just as much as we use war. And I think we've like missing the other part and we've reoriented, we've culturally reoriented like science and philosophy has oriented itself around Darwinism a little bit too much. And the Kropotkin model, I think is equally valid. Like it's like cooperation and love and stuff is just as essential for species survival and evolution. It should be a more powerful survival mechanism in the context of evolution. And it comes back to like, we think engineering is so much more important than motherhood, but it's like, if you lose the motherhood, the engineering means nothing. We have no more humans. It's like, I think our society should, the survival of the, the way we see, we conceptualize evolution should really change to also include this idea, I guess. Yeah, there's some weird thing that seems irrational that is also core to what it means to be human. So love is one such thing. They could make you do a lot of irrational things, but that depth of connection and that loyalty is a powerful thing. Are they irrational or are they rational? Like, it's like, is, you know, maybe losing out on some things in order to like keep your family together or in order, like, it's like, what are our actual values? Well, right, I mean, the rational thing is if you have a cold economist perspective, you know, motherhood or sacrificing your career for love, you know, in terms of salary, in terms of economic wellbeing, in terms of flourishing of you as a human being, that could be seen on some kind of metrics as a irrational decision, suboptimal decision, but there's the manifestation of love could be the optimal thing to do. There's a kind of saying, save one life, save the world. That's the thing that doctors often face, which is like. Well, it's considered irrational because the profit model doesn't include social good. Yes, yeah. So if a profit model includes social good, then suddenly these would be rational decisions. Might be difficult to, you know, it requires a shift in our thinking about profit and might be difficult to measure social good. Yes, but we're learning to measure a lot of things. Yeah, digitizing a lot of things. Where we're actually, you know, quantifying vision and stuff. Like we're like, you know, like you go on Facebook and they can, like Facebook can pretty much predict our behaviors. Like we're, a surprising amount of things that seem like mysterious consciousness soul things have been quantified at this point. So surely we can quantify these other things. Yeah. But as more and more of us are moving the digital space, I wanted to ask you about something. From a fan perspective, I kind of, you know, you as a musician, you as an online personality, it seems like you have all these identities and you play with them. One of the cool things about the internet, it seems like you can play with identities. So as we move into the digital world more and more, maybe even in the so called metaverse. I mean, I love the metaverse and I love the idea, but like the way this has all played out didn't go well and people are mad about it. And I think we need to like. I think that's temporary. I think it's temporary. Just like, you know how all the celebrities got together and sang the song Imagine by Jeff Leonard and everyone started hating the song Imagine. I'm hoping that's temporary because it's a damn good song. So I think it's just temporary. Like once you actually have virtual worlds, whatever they're called metaverse or otherwise, it becomes, I don't know. Well, we do have virtual worlds. Like video games, Elden Ring. Have you played Elden Ring? You haven't played Elden Ring? I'm really afraid of playing that game. Literally amazed. It looks way too fun. It looks I would wanna go there and stay there forever. It's yeah, so fun. It's so nice. Oh man, yeah. So that's the, yeah, that's a metaverse. That's a metaverse, but you're not really, how immersive is it in the sense that, does the three dimension like virtual reality integration necessary? Can we really just take our, close our eyes and kind of plug in in the 2D screen and become that other being for time and really enjoy that journey that we take? And we almost become that. You're no longer C, I'm no longer Lex, you're that creature, whatever the hell it is in that game. Yeah, that is that. I mean, that's why I love those video games. I really do become those people for a time. But like, it seems like with the idea of the metaverse, the idea of the digital space, well, even on Twitter, you get a chance to be somebody for prolonged periods of time like across a lifespan. You know, you have a Twitter account for years, for decades and you're that person. I don't know if that's a good thing. I feel very tormented by it. By Twitter specifically. By social media representation of you. I feel like the public perception of me has gotten so distorted that I find it kind of disturbing. It's one of the things that's disincentivizing me from like wanting to keep making art because I'm just like, I've completely lost control of the narrative. And the narrative is, some of it is my own stupidity, but a lot, like some of it has just been like hijacked by forces far beyond my control. I kind of got in over my head in things. Like I'm just a random Indian musician, but I just got like dragged into geopolitical matters and like financial, like the stock market and shit. And so it's just like, it's just, there are very powerful people who have at various points in time had very vested interest in making me seem insane and I can't fucking fight that. And I just like, people really want their celebrity figures to like be consistent and stay the same. And like people have a lot of like emotional investment in certain things. And like, first of all, like I'm like artificially more famous than I should be. Isn't everybody who's famous artificially famous? No, but like I should be like a weird niche indie thing. And I make pretty challenging, I do challenging weird fucking shit a lot. And I accidentally by proxy got like foisted into sort of like weird celebrity culture, but like I cannot be media trained. They have put me through so many hours of media training. I would love to see BF fly in that wall. I can't do, like when I do, I try so hard and I like learn this thing and I like got it. And I'm like, I got it, I got it, I got it. But I just can't stop saying, like my mouth just says things like, and it's just like, and I just do, I just do things. I just do crazy things. Like I'm, I just, I need to do crazy things. And it's just, I should not be, it's too jarring for people and the contradictory stuff. And then all the by association, like, you know, it's like I'm in a very weird position and my public image, the avatar of me is now this totally crazy thing that is so lost from my control. So you feel the burden of the avatar having to be static. So the avatar on Twitter or the avatar on Instagram on these social platforms is as a burden. It becomes like, cause like people don't want to accept a changing avatar, a chaotic avatar. Avatar is a stupid shit sometimes. They think the avatar is morally wrong or they think the avatar, and maybe it has been, and like I question it all the time. Like, I'm like, like, I don't know if everyone's right and I'm wrong. I don't know, like, but you know, a lot of times people ascribe intentions to things, the worst possible intentions. At this point, people think I'm, you know, but which is fine. All kinds of words, yes. Yes, and it's fine. I'm not complaining about it, but I'm just, it's a curiosity to me that we live these double, triple, quadruple lives and I have this other life that is like more people know my other life than my real life, which is interesting. Probably, I mean, you too, I guess, probably. Yeah, but I have the luxury. So we have all different, you know, like I don't know what I'm doing. There is an avatar and you're mediating who you are through that avatar. I have the nice luxury, not the luxury, maybe by intention of not trying really hard to make sure there's no difference between the avatar and the private person. Do you wear a suit all the time? Yeah. You do wear a suit? Not all the time. Recently, because I get recognized a lot, I have to not wear the suit to hide. I'm such an introvert, I'm such a social anxiety and all that kind of stuff, so I have to hide away. I love wearing a suit because it makes me feel like I'm taking the moment seriously. Like I'm, I don't know. It makes me feel like a weirdo in the best possible way. Suits feel great, every time I wear a suit, I'm like, I don't know why I'm not doing this more. Fashion in general, if you're doing it for yourself, I don't know, it's a really awesome thing. But yeah, I think there is definitely a painful way to use social media and an empowering way. And I don't know if any of us know which is which. So we're trying to figure that out. Some people, I think Doja Cat is incredible at it. Incredible, like just masterful. I don't know if you like follow that. So okay, so not taking anything seriously, joking, absurd, humor, that kind of thing. I think Doja Cat might be like the greatest living comedian right now. Like I'm more entertained by Doja Cat than actual comedians. Like she's really fucking funny on the internet. She's just great at social media. It's just, you know. Yeah, the nature of humor, like humor on social media is also a beautiful thing, the absurdity. The absurdity. And memes, like I just wanna like take a moment. I love, like when we're talking about art and credit and authenticity, I love that there's this, I mean now memes are like, they're no longer, like memes aren't like new, but it's still this emergent art form that is completely egoless and anonymous and we just don't know who made any of it. And it's like the forefront of comedy and it's just totally anonymous and it just feels really beautiful. It just feels like this beautiful collective human art project that's like this like decentralized comedy thing that just makes memes add so much to my day and many people's days. And it's just like, I don't know. I don't think people ever, I don't think we stop enough and just appreciate how sick it is that memes exist. Because also making a whole brand new art form in like the modern era that's like didn't exist before. Like, I mean they sort of existed, but the way that they exist now as like this like, you know, like me and my friends, like we joke that we go like mining for memes or farming for memes, like a video game and like meme dealers and like whatever. Like it's, you know, it's this whole, memes are this whole like new comedic language. Well, it's this art form. The interesting thing about it is that lame people seem to not be good at memes. Like corporate can't infiltrate memes. Yeah, they really can't. They try, they could try. But it's like, it's weird cause like. They try so hard and every once in a while, I'm like fine, like you got a good one. I think I've seen like one or two good ones, but like, yeah, they really can't. Cause they're even, corporate is infiltrating web three. It's making me really sad, but they can't infiltrate the memes. And I think there's something really beautiful about that. That gives power, that's why Dogecoin is powerful. It's like, all right, I'm gonna F you to sort of anybody who's trying to centralize, is trying to control the rich people that are trying to roll in and control this, control the narrative. Wow, I hadn't thought about that, but. How would you fix Twitter? How would you fix social media for your own? Like you're an optimist, you're a positive person. There's a bit of a cynicism that you have currently about this particular little slice of humanity. I tend to think Twitter could be beautiful. I'm not that cynical about it. I'm not that cynical about it. I actually refuse to be a cynic on principle. Yes. I was just briefly expressing some personal pathos. Personal stuff. It was just some personal pathos, but like, like. Just to vent a little bit, just to speak. I don't have cancer, I love my family. I have a good life. That is, if that is my biggest, one of my biggest problems. Then it's a good life. Yeah, you know, that was a brief, although I do think there are a lot of issues with Twitter just in terms of like the public mental health, but due to my proximity to the current dramas, I honestly feel that I should not have opinions about this because I think that if Elon ends up getting Twitter, that is a, being the arbiter of truth or public discussion, that is a responsibility. I do not, I am not qualified to be responsible for that. And I do not want to say something that might like dismantle democracy. And so I just like, actually, I actually think I should not have opinions about this because I truly am not, I don't want to have the wrong opinion about this. And I think I'm too close to the actual situation wherein I should not have, I have thoughts in my brain, but I think I am scared by my proximity to this situation. Isn't that crazy that a few words that you could say could change world affairs and hurt people? I mean, that's the nature of celebrity at a certain point that you have to be, you have to a little bit, a little bit, not so much that it destroys you or puts too much constraints, but you have to a little bit think about the impact of your words. I mean, we as humans, you talk to somebody at a bar, you have to think about the impact of your words. Like you can say positive things, you can say negative things, you can affect the direction of one life. But on social media, your words can affect the direction of many lives. That's crazy. It's a crazy world to live in. It's worthwhile to consider that responsibility, take it seriously. Sometimes just like you did choose kind of silence, choose sort of respectful. Like I do have a lot of thoughts on the matter. I'm just, I don't, if my thoughts are wrong, this is one situation where the stakes are high. You mentioned a while back that you were in a cult that's centered around bureaucracy, so you can't really do anything because it involves a lot of paperwork. And I really love a cult that's just like Kafkaesque. Yes. Just like. I mean, it was like a joke, but it was. I know, but I love this idea. The Holy Rain Empire. Yeah, it was just like a Kafkaesque pro bureaucracy cult. But I feel like that's what human civilization is, is that, because when you said that, I was like, oh, that is kind of what humanity is, is this bureaucracy cult. I do, yeah, I have this theory. I really think that we really, bureaucracy is starting to kill us. And I think like we need to reorient laws and stuff. Like, I think we just need sunset clauses on everything. Like, I think the rate of change in culture is happening so fast and the rate of change in technology and everything is happening so fast. It's like, when you see these hearings about like social media and Cambridge Analytica and everyone talking, it's like, even from that point, so much technological change has happened from like those hearings. And it's just like, we're trying to make all these laws now about AI and stuff. I feel like we should be updating things like every five years. And like one of the big issues in our society right now is we're just getting bogged down by laws and it's making it very hard to change things and develop things. In Austin, I don't wanna speak on this too much, but like one of my friends is working on a housing bill in Austin to try to like prevent like a San Francisco situation from happening here because obviously we're getting a little mini San Francisco here, like housing prices are skyrocketing, it's causing massive gentrification. This is really bad for anyone who's not super rich. Like, there's so much bureaucracy. Part of the reason this is happening is because you need all these permits to build. It takes like years to get permits to like build anything. It's so hard to build and so there's very limited housing and there's a massive influx of people. And it's just like, you know, this is a microcosm of like problems that are happening all over the world where it's just like, we're dealing with laws that are like 10, 20, 30, 40, 100, 200 years old and they are no longer relevant and it's just slowing everything down and causing massive social pain. Yeah, but it's like, it's also makes me sad when I see politicians talk about technology and when they don't really get it. But most importantly, they lack curiosity and like that like inspired excitement about like how stuff works and all that stuff. They're just like, they see, they have a very cynical view of technology. It's like tech companies are just trying to do evil on the world from their perspective and they have no curiosity about like how recommender systems work or how AI systems work, natural language processing, how robotics works, how computer vision works, you know. They always take the most cynical possible interpretation of what technology would be used and we should definitely be concerned about that but if you're constantly worried about that and you're regulating based on that, you're just going to slow down all the innovation. I do think a huge priority right now is undoing the bad energy surrounding the emergence of Silicon Valley. Like I think that like a lot of things were very irresponsible during that time and you know, like even just this current whole thing with Twitter and everything, it's like there has been a lot of negative outcomes from the sort of technocracy boom but one of the things that's happening is that like it's alienating people from wanting to care about technology and I actually think technology is probably some of the better, probably the best. I think we can fix a lot of our problems more easily with technology than with you know, fighting the powers that be as a you know, not to go back to the Star Wars quote or the Buckminster Fuller quote. Let's go to some dark questions. If we may for time, what is the darkest place you've ever gone in your mind? Is there a time, a period of time, a moment that you remember that was difficult for you? I mean, when I was 18, my best friend died of a heroin overdose and it was like my, and then shortly after that, one of my other best friends committed suicide and that sort of like coming into adulthood, dealing with two of the most important people in my life dying in extremely disturbing violent ways was a lot. That was a lot. Do you miss them? Yeah, definitely miss them. Did that make you think about your own life? About the finiteness of your own life? The places your mind can go? Did you ever in the distance, far away contemplate just your own death? Or maybe even taking your own life? Oh never, oh no. I'm so, I love my life. I cannot fathom suicide. I'm so scared of death. I haven't, I'm too scared of death. My manager, my manager's like the most Zen guy. My manager's always like, you need to accept death. You need to accept death. And I'm like, look, I can do your meditation. I can do the meditation, but I cannot accept death. I like, I will fight, I'm terrified of death. I will like fight. Although I actually think death is important. I recently went to this meeting about immortality and in the process of. That's the actual topic of the meeting? I'm sorry. No, no, it was this girl. It was a bunch of people working on like anti aging stuff. It was like some like seminary thing about it. And I went in really excited. I was like, yeah, like, okay, like, what do you got? Like, how can I live for 500 years or a thousand years? And then like over the course of the meeting, like it was sort of like, right. It was like two or three days after the Russian invasion started. And I was like, man, like, what if Putin was immortal? Like, what if I'm like, man, maybe immortality, is not good. I mean, like if you get into the later Dune stuff, the immortals cause a lot of problem. Cause as we were talking about earlier with the music and like brains calcify, like good people could become immortal, but bad people could become immortal. But I also think even the best people power corrupts and power alienates you from like the common human experience and. Right, so the people that get more and more powerful. Even the best people who like, whose brains are amazing, like I think death might be important. I think death is part of, you know, like I think with AI one thing we might want to consider, I don't know, when I talk about AI, I'm such not an expert and probably everyone has all these ideas and they're already figured out. But when I was talking. Nobody is an expert in anything. See, okay, go ahead. But when I. You were talking about. Yeah, but I like, it's just like, I think some kind of pruning. But it's a tricky thing because if there's too much of a focus on youth culture, then you don't have the wisdom. So I feel like we're in a tricky, we're in a tricky moment right now in society where it's like, we've really perfected living for a long time. So there's all these really like old people who are like really voting against the wellbeing of the young people, you know? And like, it's like there shouldn't be all this student dead and we need like healthcare, like universal healthcare and like just voting against like best interests. But then you have all these young people that don't have the wisdom that are like, yeah, we need communism and stuff. And it's just like, like literally I got canceled at one point for, I ironically used a Stalin quote in my high school yearbook, but it was actually like a diss against my high school. I saw that. Yeah, and people were like, you used to be a Stalinist and now you're a class traitor and it's like, it's like, oh man, just like, please Google Stalin. Please Google Stalin. Like, you know. Ignoring the lessons of history, yes. And it's like, we're in this really weird middle ground where it's like, we are not finding the happy medium between wisdom and fresh ideas and they're fighting each other. And it's like, like really, like what we need is like the fresh ideas and the wisdom to be like collaborating. And it's like. What the fighting in a way is the searching for the happy medium. And in a way, maybe we are finding the happy medium. Maybe that's what the happy medium looks like. And for AI systems, there has to be, it's, you know, you have the reinforcement learning, you have the dance between exploration and exploitation, sort of doing crazy stuff to see if there's something better than what you think is the optimal and then doing the optimal thing and dancing back and forth from that. You would, Stuart Russell, I don't know if you know that, is AI guy with, thinks about sort of how to control super intelligent AI systems. And his idea is that we should inject uncertainty and sort of humility into AI systems that they never, as they get wiser and wiser and wiser and more intelligent, they're never really sure. They always doubt themselves. And in some sense, when you think of young people, that's a mechanism for doubt. It's like, it's how society doubts whether the thing it has converged towards is the right answer. So the voices of the young people is a society asking itself a question. The way I've been doing stuff for the past 50 years, maybe it's the wrong way. And so you can have all of that within one AI system. I also think, though, that we need to, I mean, actually, that's actually really interesting and really cool. But I also think there's a fine balance of, I think we maybe also overvalue the idea that the old systems are always bad. And I think there are things that we are perfecting and we might be accidentally overthrowing things that we actually have gotten to a good point. Just because we value disruption so much and we value fighting against the generations before us so much that there's also an aspect of, sometimes we're taking two steps forward, one step back because, okay, maybe we kind of did solve this thing and now we're like fucking it up, you know? And so I think there's like a middle ground there too. Yeah, we're in search of that happy medium. Let me ask you a bunch of crazy questions, okay? All right. You can answer in a short way or in a long way. What's the scariest thing you've ever done? These questions are gonna be ridiculous. Something tiny or something big. Something big, skydiving or touring your first record, going on this podcast. I've had two crazy brushes, like really scary brushes with death where I randomly got away on scay. I don't know if I should talk about those on here. Well, I don't know. I think I might be the luckiest person alive though. Like this might be too dark for a podcast though. I feel like, I don't know if this is like good content for a podcast. I don't know what is good content. It might hijack. Here's a safer one. I mean, having a baby really scared me. Before. Just the birth process. Surgery, like just having a baby is really scary. So just like the medical aspect of it, not the responsibility. Were you ready for the responsibility? Did you, were you ready to be a mother? All the beautiful things that comes with motherhood that you were talking about. All the changes and all that, were you ready for that? Or did you feel ready for that? No, I think it took about nine months to start getting ready for it. And I'm still getting more ready for it because now you keep realizing more things as they start getting. As the consciousness grows. And stuff you didn't notice with the first one, now that you've seen the first one older, you're noticing it more. Like the sort of like existential horror of coming into consciousness with Baby Y or Baby Sailor Mars or whatever. She has like so many names at this point that it's, we really need to probably settle on one. If you could be someone else for a day, someone alive today, but somebody you haven't met yet, who would you be? Would I be modeling their brain state or would I just be in their body? You can choose the degree to which you're modeling their brain state. Cause you can still take a third person perspective and realize, you have to realize that you're. Can they be alive or can it be dead? No, oh. They would be brought back to life, right? If they're dead. Yeah, you can bring people back. Definitely Hitler or Stalin. I wanna understand evil. You would need to, oh, to experience what it feels like. I wanna be in their brain feeling what they feel. I might change you forever returning from that. Yes, but I think it would also help me understand how to prevent it and fix it. That might be one of those things, once you experience it, it'll be a burden to know it. Cause you won't be able to transfer that. Yeah, but a lot of things are burdens. But it's a useful burden. But it's a useful burden, yeah. That for sure, I wanna understand evil and psychopathy and that. I have all these fake Twitter accounts where I go into different algorithmic bubbles to try to understand. I'll keep getting in fights with people and realize we're not actually fighting. I think we used to exist in a monoculture before social media and stuff. We kinda all got fed the same thing. So we were all speaking the same cultural language. But I think recently, one of the things that we aren't diagnosing properly enough with social media is that there's different dialects. There's so many different dialects of Chinese. There are now becoming different dialects of English. I am realizing there are people who are saying the exact same things, but they're using completely different verbiage. And we're punishing each other for not using the correct verbiage. And we're completely misunderstanding. People are just misunderstanding what the other people are saying. And I just got in a fight with a friend about anarchism and communism and shit for two hours. And then by the end of a conversation, and then she'd say something, and I'm like, but that's literally what I'm saying. And she was like, what? And then I was like, fuck, we've different, I'm like, our English, the way we are understanding terminology is like drastically, like our algorithm bubbles are creating mini dialects. Of how language is interpreted, how language is used. That's so fascinating. And so we're like having these arguments that we do not need to be having. And there's polarization that's happening that doesn't need to be happening because we've got these like algorithmically created dialects occurring. Plus on top of that, there's also different parts of the world that speak different languages. So there's literally lost in translation kind of communication. I happen to know the Russian language and just know how different it is. Then the English language. And I just wonder how much is lost in a little bit of. Man, I actually, cause I have a question for you. I have a song coming out tomorrow with I Speak Who Are A Russian Band. And I speak a little bit of Russian and I was looking at the title and the title in English doesn't match the title in Russian. I'm curious about this. Cause look, it says the title in English is Last Day. And then the title in Russian is New Day. My pronunciation sucks. New Day. Like what? Like a new day. A new day. Yeah, new day, new day. Like it's two different meanings. Yeah, new day, yeah. Yeah, yeah, new day. New day, but last day. New day. So last day would be the last day. Yeah. Maybe they. Or maybe the title includes both the Russian and it's for. Maybe. Maybe it's for bilingual. But to be honest, Novodin sounds better than just musically. Like Novodin is new day. That's the current one. And Posledniy Den is the last day. I think Novodin. I don't like Novodin. But the meaning is so different. That's kind of awesome actually though. There's an explicit sort of contrast like that. If everyone on earth disappeared and it was just you left, what would your day look like? Like what would you do? Everybody's dead. As far as you. Are there corpses there? Well seriously, it's a big. Let me think through this. It's a big difference if there's just like birds singing versus if there's like corpses littering the street. Yeah, there's corpses everywhere, I'm sorry. It's, and you don't actually know what happened and you don't know why you survived. And you don't even know if there's others out there. But it seems clear that it's all gone. What would you do? What would I do? Listen, I'm somebody who really enjoys the moment, enjoys life. I would just go on like enjoying the inanimate objects. I would just look for food, basic survival. But most of it is just, listen, when I just, I take walks and I look outside and I'm just happy that we get to exist on this planet, to be able to breathe air. It's just all beautiful. It's full of colors, all of this kind of stuff. Just, there's so many things about life, your own life, conscious life that's fucking awesome. So I would just enjoy that. But also maybe after a few weeks, the engineer would start coming out, like wanna build some things. Maybe there's always hope searching for another human. Maybe. Probably searching for another human. Probably trying to get to a TV or radio station and broadcast something. That's interesting, I didn't think about that. So like really maximize your ability to connect with others. Yeah, like probably try to find another person. Would you be excited to see, to meet another person or terrified? Because, you know. I'd be excited. No matter what. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Being alone for the last however long of my life would be really bad. That's the one instance I might, I don't think I'd kill myself, but I might kill myself if I had to. So you love people. You love connection to other humans. Yeah. I kinda hate people too, but yeah. That's a love hate relationship. Yeah. I feel like we'd have a bunch of weird Nietzsche questions and stuff though. Oh yeah. Like I wonder, cause I'm like, when podcast, I'm like, is this interesting for people to just have like, or I don't know, maybe people do like this. When I listen to podcasts, I'm into like the lore, like the hard lore. Like I just love like Dan Carlin. I'm like, give me the facts. Just like, like the facts into my bloodstream. But you also don't know, like you're a fascinating mind to explore. So you don't realize as you're talking about stuff, the stuff you've taken for granted is actually unique and fascinating. The way you think. Not always what, like the way you reason through things is the fascinating thing to listen to. Because people kind of see, oh, there's other humans that think differently, that explore thoughts differently. That's the cool, that's also cool. So yeah, Dan Carlin retelling of history. By the way, his retelling of history is very, I think what's exciting is not the history, is his way of thinking about history. No, I think Dan Carlin is one of the people, like when, Dan Carlin is one of the people that really started getting me excited about like revolutionizing education. Because like Dan Carlin instilled, I already like really liked history, but he instilled like an obsessive love of history in me to the point where like now I'm fucking reading, like going to bed, reading like part four of The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich or whatever. Like I got like dense ass history, but like he like opened that door that like made me want to be a scholar of that topic. Like it's like, I feel like he's such a good teacher. He just like, you know, and it sort of made me feel like one of the things we could do with education is like find like the world's great, the teachers that like create passion for the topic because autodidactricism, I don't know how to say that properly, but like self teaching is like much faster than being lectured to. Like it's much more efficient to sort of like be able to teach yourself and then ask a teacher questions when you don't know what's up. But like, you know, that's why it's like in university and stuff, like you can learn so much more material so much faster because you're doing a lot of the learning on your own and you're going to the teachers for when you get stuck. But like these teachers that can inspire passion for a topic, I think that is one of the most invaluable skills in our whole species. Like, because if you can do that, then you, it's like AI, like AI is going to teach itself so much more efficiently than we can teach it. We just needed to get it to the point where it can teach itself. And then. It finds the motivation to do so, right? Yeah. So like you inspire it to do so. Yeah. And then it could teach itself. What do you make of the fact, you mentioned Rise and Fall of the Third Reich. I just. Have you read that? Yeah, I read it twice. You read it twice? Yes. Okay, so no one even knows what it is. Yeah. And I'm like, wait, I thought this was like a super poppin book. Super pop. Yeah, I'm not like that, I'm not that far in it. But it is, it's so interesting. Yeah, it's written by a person that was there, which is very important to kind of. You know, you start being like, how could this possibly happen? And then when you read Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, it's like, people tried really hard for this to not happen. People tried, they almost reinstated a monarchy at one point to try to stop this from happening. Like they almost like abandoned democracy to try to get this to not happen. At least the way it makes me feel is that there's a bunch of small moments on which history can turn. Yes. It's like small meetings. Yes. Human interactions. And it's both terrifying and inspiring because it's like, even just attempts at assassinating Hitler, like time and time again failed. And they were so close. Was it like Operation Valkyrie? Such a good. And then there's also the role of, that's a really heavy burden, which is from a geopolitical perspective, the role of leaders to see evil before it truly becomes evil, to anticipate it, to stand up to evil. Because evil is actually pretty rare in this world at a scale that Hitler was. We tend to, you know, in the modern discourse kind of call people evil too quickly. If you look at ancient history, like there was a ton of Hitlers. I actually think it's more the norm than, like again, going back to like my sort of intelligent design theory, I think one of the things we've been successfully doing in our slow move from survival of the fittest to intelligent design is we've kind of been eradicating, like if you look at like ancient Assyria and stuff, like that shit was like brutal and just like the heads on the, like brutal, like Genghis Khan just like genocide after genocide was like throwing plague bodies over the walls and decimating whole cities or like the Muslim conquests of like Damascus and shit. Just like people, cities used to get leveled all the fucking time. Okay, get into the Bronze Age collapse. It's basically, there was like almost like Roman level like society. Like there was like all over the world, like global trade, like everything was awesome through a mix of, I think a bit of climate change and then the development of iron because basically bronze could only come from this, the way to make bronze, like everything had to be funneled through this one Iranian mine. And so it's like, there was just this one supply chain and this is one of the things that makes me worried about supply chains and why I think we need to be so thoughtful about, I think our biggest issue with society right now, like the thing that is most likely to go wrong is probably supply chain collapse, because war, climate change, whatever, like anything that causes supply chain collapse, our population is too big to handle that. And like the thing that seems to cause Dark Ages is mass supply chain collapse. But the Bronze Age collapse happened like, it was sort of like this ancient collapse that happened where like literally like ancient Egypt, all these cities, everything just got like decimated, destroyed, abandoned cities, like hundreds of them. There was like a flourishing society, like we were almost coming to modernity and everything got leveled. And they had this mini Dark Ages, but it was just like, there's so little writing or recording from that time that like, there isn't a lot of information about the Bronze Age collapse, but it was basically equivalent to like medieval, the medieval Dark Ages. But it just happened, I don't know the years, but like thousands of years earlier. And then we sort of like recovered from the Bronze Age collapse, empire reemerged, writing and trade and everything reemerged. And then we of course had the more contemporary Dark Ages. And then over time, we've designed mechanism to lessen and lessen the capability for the destructive power centers to emerge. There's more recording about the more contemporary Dark Ages. So I think we have like a better understanding of how to avoid it, but I still think we're at high risk for it. I think that's one of the big risks right now. So the natural state of being for humans is for there to be a lot of Hitlers, which has gotten really good at making it hard for them to emerge. We've gotten better at collaboration and resisting the power, like authoritarians to come to power. We're trying to go country by country, like we're moving past this. We're kind of like slowly incrementally, like moving towards like not scary old school war stuff. And I think seeing it happen in some of the countries that at least nominally are like supposed to have moved past that, that's scary because it reminds us that it can happen like in the places that have moved supposedly, as hopefully moved past that. And possibly at a civilization level, like you said, supply chain collapse might make people resource constraint, might make people desperate, angry, hateful, violent, and drag us right back in. I mean, supply chain collapse is how, like the ultimate thing that caused the Middle Ages was supply chain collapse. It's like people, because people were reliant on a certain level of technology, like people, like you look at like Britain, like they had glass, like people had aqueducts, people had like indoor heating and cooling and like running water and like buy food from all over the world and trade and markets. Like people didn't know how to hunt and forage and gather. And so we're in a similar situation. We are not educated enough to survive without technology. So if we have a supply chain collapse that like limits our access to technology, there will be like massive starvation and violence and displacement and war. Like, you know, it's like, yeah. In my opinion, it's like the primary marker of like what a dark age is. Well, technology is kind of enabling us to be more resilient in terms of supply chain, in terms of, to all the different catastrophic events that happened to us. Although the pandemic has kind of challenged our preparedness for the catastrophic. What do you think is the coolest invention humans come up with? The wheel, fire, cooking meat. Computers. Computers. Freaking computers. Internet or computers? Which one? What do you think the? Previous technologies, I mean, may have even been more profound and moved us to a certain degree, but I think the computers are what make us homo tech now. I think this is what, it's a brain augmentation. And so it like allows for actual evolution. Like the computers accelerate the degree to which all the other technologies can also be accelerated. Would you classify yourself as a homo sapien or a homo techno? Definitely homo techno. So you're one of the earliest of the species. I think most of us are. Like, as I said, like, I think if you like looked at brain scans of us versus humans a hundred years ago, it would look very different. I think we are physiologically different. Just even the interaction with the devices has changed our brains. Well, and if you look at, a lot of studies are coming out to show that like, there's a degree of inherited memory. So some of these physiological changes in theory should be, we should be passing them on. So like that's, you know, that's not like a, an instance of physiological change that's gonna fizzle out. In theory, that should progress like to our offspring. Speaking of offspring, what advice would you give to a young person, like in high school, whether there be an artist, a creative, an engineer, any kind of career path, or maybe just life in general, how they can live a life they can be proud of? I think one of my big thoughts, and like, especially now having kids, is that I don't think we spend enough time teaching creativity. And I think creativity is a muscle like other things. And there's a lot of emphasis on, you know, learn how to play the piano. And then you can write a song or like learn the technical stuff. And then you can do a thing. But I think it's, like, I have a friend who's like world's greatest guitar player, like, you know, amazing sort of like producer, works with other people, but he's really sort of like, you know, he like engineers and records things and like does solos, but he doesn't really like make his own music. And I was talking to him and I was like, dude, you're so talented at music. Like, why don't you make music or whatever? And he was like, cause I got, I'm too old. I never learned the creative muscle. And it's like, you know, it's embarrassing. It's like learning the creative muscle takes a lot of failure. And it also sort of, if when you're being creative, you know, you're throwing paint at a wall and a lot of stuff will fail. So like part of it is like a tolerance for failure and humiliation. And that's somehow that's easier to develop when you're young or be persist through it when you're young. Everything is easier to develop when you're young. Yes. And the younger, the better. It could destroy you. I mean, that's the shitty thing about creativity. If, you know, failure could destroy you if you're not careful, but that's a risk worth taking. But also, but at a young age, developing a tolerance to failure is good. I fail all the time. Like I do stupid shit all the time. Like in public, in private, I get canceled for, I've make all kinds of mistakes, but I just like am very resilient about making mistakes. And so then like I do a lot of things that like other people wouldn't do. And like, I think my greatest asset is my creativity. And I like, I think pain, like tolerance to failure is just a super essential thing that should be taught before other things. Brilliant advice. Yeah, yeah. I wish everybody encouraged sort of failure more as opposed to kind of. Cause we like punish failure. We're like, no, like when we were teaching kids, we're like, no, that's wrong. Like that's, you know, like X keeps like will be like wrong. at the, because I, you know, when I met him, I came in all furious about Spotify and like I grilled him super hard. So I've got his answers here. But he was saying like at the sort of peak of the CD industry, there was like 20,000 artists making millions and millions of dollars. Like there was just like a very tiny kind of 1%. And Spotify has kind of democratized the industry because now I think he said there's about a million artists making a good living from Spotify. And when I heard that, I was like, honestly, I would rather make less money and have just like a decent living and have more artists be able to have that, even though I like, I wish it could include everyone, but. Yeah, that's really hard to argue with. YouTube is the same. It's YouTube's mission. They want to basically have as many creators as possible and make a living, some kind of living. And that's so hard to argue with. It's so hard. But I think there's better ways to do it. My manager, I actually wish he was here. Like I would have brought him up. My manager is building an app that can manage you. So it'll like help you organize your percentages and get your publishing and dah, dah, dah, dah, dah. So you can take out all the middlemen so you can have a much bigger, it'll just like automate it. So you can get. So automate the manager? Automate management, publishing, and legal, it can read, the app he's building can read your contract and like tell you about it. Because one of the issues with music right now, it's not that we're not getting paid enough, but it's that the art industry is filled with middlemen because artists are not good at business. And from the beginning, like Frank Sinatra, it's all mob stuff. Like it's the music industry is run by business people, not the artists and the artists really get very small cuts of like what they make. And so I think part of the reason I'm a technocrat, which I mean, your fans are gonna be technocrats. So no one's, they're not gonna be mad at me about this, but like my fans hate it when I say this kind of thing or the general public. They don't like technocrats. They don't like technocrats. Like when I watched Battle Angel Alita and they were like the Martian technocracy and I was like, yeah, Martian technocracy. And then they were like, and they're evil. And I was like, oh, okay. I was like, cause Martian technocracy sounds sick to me. Yeah, so your intuition as technocrats would create some kind of beautiful world. For example, what my manager's working on, if you can create an app that removes the need for a lawyer and then you could have smart contracts on the blockchain, removes the need for like management and organizing all this stuff, like can read your stuff and explain it to you, can collect your royalties, you know, like then the small amounts, the amount of money that you're getting from Spotify actually means a lot more and goes a lot farther. It can remove some of the bureaucracy, some of the inefficiencies that make life not as great as it could be. Yeah, I think the issue isn't that there's not enough. Like the issue is that there's inefficiency and I'm really into this positive sum mindset, you know, the win, win mindset of like, instead of, you know, fighting over the scraps, how do we make the, or worrying about scarcity, like instead of a scarcity mindset, why don't we just increase the efficiency and, you know, in that way. Expand the size of the pie. Let me ask you about experimentation. So you said, which is beautiful, being a musician is like having a conversation with all those that came before you. How much of creating music is like kind of having that conversation, trying to fit into the cultural trends and how much of it is like trying to, as much as possible, be an outsider and come up with something totally new. It's like when you're thinking, when you're experimenting, are you trying to be totally different, totally weird? Are you trying to fit in? Man, this is so hard because I feel like I'm kind of in the process of semi retiring from music, so this is like my old brain. Yeah, bring it from like the shelf, put it on the table for a couple minutes, we'll just poke it. I think it's a bit of both because I think forcing yourself to engage with new music is really great for neuroplasticity. Like I think, you know, as people, part of the reason music is marketed at young people is because young people are very neuroplastic. So like if you're 16 to like 23 or whatever, it's gonna be really easy for you to love new music. And if you're older than that, it gets harder and harder and harder. And I think one of the beautiful things about being a musician is I just constantly force myself to listen to new music and I think it keeps my brain really plastic. And I think this is a really good exercise. I just think everyone should do this. You listen to new music and you hate it, I think you should just keep, force yourself to like, okay, well why do people like it? And like, you know, make your brain form new neural pathways and be more open to change. That's really brilliant actually. Sorry to interrupt, but like that exercise is really amazing to sort of embrace change, embrace sort of practice neuroplasticity. Because like that's one of the things, you fall in love with a certain band and you just kind of stay with that for the rest of your life and then you never understand the modern music. That's a really good exercise. Most of the streaming on Spotify is like classic rock and stuff. Like new music makes up a very small chunk of what is played on Spotify. And I think this is like not a good sign for us as a species. I think, yeah. So it's a good measure of the species open mindedness to change is how often you listen to new music. The brain, let's put the music brain back on the shelf. I gotta pull out the futurist brain for a second. In what wild ways do you think the future, say in like 30 years, maybe 50 years, maybe a hundred years will be different from our current way of life on earth? We can talk about augmented reality, virtual reality, maybe robots, maybe space travel, maybe video games, maybe genetic engineering. I can keep going. Cyborgs, aliens, world wars, maybe destructive nuclear wars, good and bad. When you think about the future, what are you imagining? What's the weirdest and the wildest it could be? Have you read Surface Detail by Iain Banks? Surface Detail is my favorite depiction of a, oh wow, you have to read this book. It's literally the greatest science fiction book possibly ever written. Iain Banks is the man, yeah, for sure. What have you read? Just the Player of Games. I read that titles can't be copyrighted so you can just steal them. And I was like, Player of Games, sick. Nice. Yeah, so you can name your album. Like I always wanted to. Romeo and Juliet or something. I always wanted to name an album War and Peace. Nice. Like that would be, like you. That is a good, that's a good, where have I heard that before? You can do that, like you could do that. Also things that are in the public domain. For people who have no clue, you do have a song called Player of Games. Yes, oh yeah. So Iain Banks, Surface Detail is in my opinion the best future that I've ever read about or heard about in science fiction. Basically there's the relationship with super intelligence, like artificial super intelligence is just, it's like great. I want to credit the person who coined this term because I love this term. And I feel like young women don't get enough credit in. Yeah, so if you go to Protopia Futures on Instagram, what is her name? Personalized donor experience at scale, our AI power donor experience. Monica Bealskite, I'm saying that wrong. And I'm probably gonna, I'm probably butchering this a bit, but Protopia is sort of, if utopia is unattainable, Protopia is sort of like, you know. Wow, that's an awesome Instagram, Protopia Futures. A great, a future that is, you know, as good as we can get. The future, positive future. AI, is this a centralized AI in Surface Detail or is it distributed? What kind of AI is it? They mostly exist as giant super ships, like sort of like the guild ships in Dune. Like they're these giant ships that kind of move people around and the ships are sentient and they can talk to all the passengers. And I mean, there's a lot of different types of AI in the Banksyan future, but in the opening scene of Surface Detail, there's this place called the Culture and the Culture is basically a Protopian future. And a Protopian future, I think, is like a future that is like, obviously it's not utopia, it's not perfect. And like, cause like striving for utopia, I think feels hopeless and it's sort of like, maybe not the best terminology to be using. So it's like, it's a pretty good place. Like mostly like, you know, super intelligence and biological beings exist fairly in harmony. There's not too much war. There's like as close to equality as you can get, you know, it's like approximately a good future. Like there's really awesome stuff. It's, and in the opening scene, this girl, she's born as a sex slave outside of the culture. So she's in a society that doesn't adhere to the cultural values. She tries to kill the guy who is her like master, but he kills her, but unbeknownst to her, when she was traveling on a ship through the culture Like he'll say like crazy things. Like X keeps being like, like bubble car, bubble car. And I'm like, and you know, I'm like, what's a bubble car? Like, but like, it doesn't like, but I don't want to be like, no, you're wrong. I'm like, you're thinking of weird, crazy shit. Like, I don't know what a bubble car is, but like. It's creating worlds and they might be internally consistent. And through that, you might discover something fundamental about this world. Yeah, or he'll like rewrite songs, like with words that he prefers. So like, instead of baby shark, he says baby car. It's like. Maybe he's onto something. Let me ask the big, ridiculous question. We were kind of dancing around it, but what do you think is the meaning of this whole thing we have here of human civilization, of life on earth, but in general, just life? What's the meaning of life? C. Have you, did you read Nova Scene yet? By James Lovelock? You're doing a lot of really good book recommendations here. I haven't even finished this, so I'm a huge fraud yet again. But like really early in the book, he says this amazing thing. Like, I feel like everyone's so sad and cynical. Like everyone's like the Fermi paradox and everyone. I just keep hearing people being like, fuck, what if we're alone? Like, oh no, ah, like, ah, ah. And I'm like, okay, but like, wait, what if this is the beginning? Like in Nova Scene, he says, this is not gonna be a correct, I can't like memorize quotes, but he says something like, what if our consciousness, like right now, like this is the universe waking up? Like what if instead of discovering the universe, this is the universe, like this is the evolution of the literal universe herself. Like we are not separate from the universe. Like this is the universe waking up. This is the universe seeing herself for the first time. Like this is. The universe becoming conscious. The first time we were a part of that. Yeah, cause it's like, we aren't separate from the universe. Like this could be like an incredibly sacred moment and maybe like social media and all this things, the stuff where we're all getting connected together. Like maybe these are the neurons connecting of the like collective super intelligence that is, Waking up. The, yeah, like, you know, it's like, maybe instead of something cynical or maybe if there's something to discover, like maybe this is just, you know, we're a blast assist of like some incredible kind of consciousness or being. And just like in the first three years of life or for human children, we'll forget about all the suffering that we're going through now. I think we'll probably forget about this. I mean, probably, you know, artificial intelligence will eventually render us obsolete. I don't think they'll do it in a malicious way, but I think probably we are very weak. The sun is expanding. Like, I don't know, like, hopefully we can get to Mars, but like, we're pretty vulnerable. And I, you know, like, I think we can coexist for a long time with AI and we can also probably make ourselves less vulnerable, but, you know, I just think consciousness, sentience, self awareness, like, I think this might be the single greatest like moment in evolution ever. And like, maybe this is, you know, the big, like the true beginning of life. And we're just, we're the blue green algae or we're like the single celled organisms of something amazing. The universe awakens and this is it. Yeah. Well, see, you're an incredible person. You're a fascinating mind. You should definitely do, your friend Liv mentioned that you guys were thinking of maybe talking. I would love it if you explored your mind in this kind of media more and more by doing a podcast with her or just in any kind of way. So you're an awesome person. It's an honor to know you. It's an honor to get to sit down with you late at night, which is like surreal. And I really enjoyed it. Thank you for talking today. Yeah, no, I mean, huge honor. I feel very underqualified to be here, but I'm a big fan. I've been listening to the podcast a lot and yeah, me and Liv would appreciate any advice and help and we're definitely gonna do that. So yeah. Anytime. Thank you. Cool, thank you. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Grimes. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from Oscar Wilde. Yes, I'm a dreamer. For a dreamer is one who can only find her way by moonlight and her punishment is that she sees the dawn before the rest of the world. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time. with him one day, a ship put a neural lace in her head and neural lace is sort of like, it's basically a Neuralink because life imitates art. It does indeed. It does indeed. So she wakes up and the opening scene is her memory has been uploaded by this neural lace when she has been killed. And now she gets to choose a new body. And this AI is interfacing with her recorded memory in her neural lace and helping her and being like, hello, you're dead. But because you had a neural lace, your memory's uploaded. Do you want to choose a new body? And you're going to be born here in the culture and like start a new life, which is just, that's like the opening. It's like so sick. And the ship is the super intelligence. All the ships are kind of super intelligence. But they still want to preserve a kind of rich, fulfilling experience for the humans. Yeah, like they're like friends with the humans. And then there's a bunch of ships that don't want to exist with biological beings, but they just have their own place like way over there. But they don't, they just do their own thing. They're not necessarily. So it's a pretty, this protopian existence is pretty peaceful. Yeah, I mean, and then, for example, one of the main fights in the book is they're fighting, there's these artificial hells that, and people don't think it's ethical to have artificial hell. Like basically when people do crime, they get sent, like when they die, their memory gets sent to an artificial hell and they're eternally tortured. And so, and then the way that society is deciding whether or not to have the artificial hell is that they're having these simulated, they're having like a simulated war. So instead of actual blood, you know, people are basically essentially fighting in a video game to choose the outcome of this. But they're still experiencing the suffering in this artificial hell or no? Can you experience stuff or? So the artificial hell sucks. And a lot of people in the culture want to get rid of the artificial hell. There's a simulated wars, are they happening in the artificial hell? So no, the simulated wars are happening outside of the artificial hell, between the political factions who are, so this political faction says we should have simulated hell to deter crime. And this political faction is saying, no, simulated hell is unethical. And so instead of like having, you know, blowing each other up with nukes, they're having like a giant Fortnite battle to decide this, which, you know, to me that's protopia. That's like, okay, we can have war without death. You know, I don't think there should be simulated hells. I think that is definitely one of the ways in which technology could go very, very, very, very wrong. So almost punishing people in a digital space or something like that. Yeah, like torturing people's memories. So either as a deterrent, like if you committed a crime, but also just for personal pleasure, if there's some sick, demented humans in this world. Dan Carlin actually has this episode of Hardcore History on painful attainment. Oh, that episode is fucked. It's dark, because he kind of goes through human history and says like, we as humans seem to enjoy, secretly enjoy or used to be openly enjoy sort of the torture and the death, watching the death and torture of other humans. I do think if people were consenting, we should be allowed to have gladiatorial matches. But consent is hard to achieve in those situations. It always starts getting slippery. Like it could be also forced consent, like it starts getting weird. There's way too much excitement. Like this is what he highlights. There's something about human nature that wants to see that violence. And it's really dark. And you hope that we can sort of overcome that aspect of human nature, but that's still within us somewhere. Well, I think that's what we're doing right now. I have this theory that what is very important about the current moment is that all of evolution has been survival of the fittest up until now. And at some point, the lines are kind of fuzzy, but in the recent past, or maybe even just right now, we're getting to this point where we can choose intelligent design. Like we probably since like the integration of the iPhone, like we are becoming cyborgs. Like our brains are fundamentally changed. Everyone who grew up with electronics, we are fundamentally different from previous, from homo sapiens. I call us homo techno. I think we have evolved into homo techno, which is like essentially a new species. Like if you look at the way, if you took an MRI of my brain and you took an MRI of like a medieval brain, I think it would be very different the way that it has evolved. Do you think when historians look back at this time, they'll see like this was a fundamental shift to what a human being is? I think, I do not think we are still homo sapiens. I believe we are homo techno. And I think we have evolved. And I think right now, the way we are evolving, we can choose how we do that. And I think we are being very reckless about how we're doing that. Like we're just having social media, but I think this idea that like this is a time to choose intelligent design should be taken very seriously. It like now is the moment to reprogram the human computer. It's like, if you go blind, your visual cortex will get taken over with other functions. We can choose our own evolution. We can change the way our brains work. And so we actually have a huge responsibility to do that. And I think I'm not sure who should be responsible for that, but there's definitely not adequate education. We're being inundated with all this technology that is fundamentally changing the physical structure of our brains. And we are not adequately responding to that to choose how we wanna evolve. And we could evolve, we could be really whatever we want. And I think this is a really important time. And I think if we choose correctly and we choose wisely, consciousness could exist for a very long time and integration with AI could be extremely positive. And I don't think enough people are focusing on this specific situation. Do you think we might irreversibly screw things up if we get things wrong now? Because the flip side of that, it seems humans are pretty adaptive. So maybe the way we figure things out is by screwing it up, like social media. Over a generation, we'll see the negative effects of social media, and then we build new social medias, and we just keep improving stuff. And then we learn from the failures of the past. Because humans seem to be really adaptive. On the flip side, we can get it wrong in a way where literally we create weapons of war or increase hate. Past a certain threshold, we really do a lot of damage. I mean, I think we're optimized to notice the negative things. But I would actually say one of the things that I think people aren't noticing is if you look at Silicon Valley and you look at the technocracy, like what's been happening there. When Silicon Valley started, it was all just Facebook and all this for profit crap that really wasn't particular. I guess it was useful, but it's sort of just whatever. But now you see lab grown meat, compostable, or biodegradable, single use cutlery, or meditation apps. I think we are actually evolving and changing, and technology is changing. I think there just maybe there isn't quite enough education about this. And also, I don't know if there's quite enough incentive for it because I think the way capitalism works, what we define as profit, we're also working on an old model of what we define as profit. I really think if we changed the idea of profit to include social good, you can have economic profit, social good also counting as profit would incentivize things that are more useful and more whatever spiritual technology or positive technology or things that help reprogram a human computer in a good way or things that help us intelligently design our new brains. Yeah, there's no reason why within the framework of capitalism, the word profit or the idea of profit can't also incorporate the well being of a human being. So like long term well being, long term happiness. Or even for example, we were talking about motherhood, like part of the reason I'm so late is because I had to get the baby to bed. And it's like, I keep thinking about motherhood, how under capitalism, it's like this extremely essential job that is very difficult that is not compensated. And we sort of like value things by how much we compensate them. And so we really devalue motherhood in our society and pretty much all societies. Like capitalism does not recognize motherhood. It's just a job that you're supposed to do for free. And it's like, but I feel like producing great humans should be seen as a great, as profit under capitalism. Like that should be, that's like a huge social good. Like every awesome human that gets made adds so much to the world. So like if that was integrated into the profit structure, then, you know, and if we potentially found a way to compensate motherhood. So come up with a compensation that's much broader than just money or. Or it could just be money. Like, what if you just made, I don't know, but I don't know how you'd pay for that. Like, I mean, that's where you start getting into. Reallocation of resources that people get upset over. Well, like what if we made like a motherhood Dow? Yeah, yeah. And, you know, used it to fund like single mothers, like, you know, pay for making babies. So, I mean, if you create and put beautiful things onto the world, that could be companies, that can be bridges, that could be art, that could be a lot of things, and that could be children, which are. Or education or. Anything, that should be valued by society, and that should be somehow incorporated into the framework of what, as a market, of what. Like, if you contribute children to this world, that should be valued and respected and sort of celebrated, like, proportional to what it is, which is, it's the thing that fuels human civilization. Yeah, like I. It's kind of important. I feel like everyone's always saying, I mean, I think we're in very different social spheres, but everyone's always saying, like, dismantle capitalism. And I'm like, well, okay, well, I don't think the government should own everything. Like, I don't think we should not have private ownership. Like, that's scary. You know, like that starts getting into weird stuff and just sort of like, I feel there's almost no way to do that without a police state, you know? But obviously, capitalism has some major flaws. And I think actually Mac showed me this idea called social capitalism, which is a form of capitalism that just like considers social good to be also profit. Like, you know, it's like, right now companies need to, like, you're supposed to grow every quarter or whatever to like show that you're functioning well, but it's like, okay, well, what if you kept the same amount of profit? You're still in the green, but then you have also all this social good. Like, do you really need all this extra economic growth or could you add this social good and that counts? And, you know, I don't know if, I am not an economist. I have no idea how this could be achieved, but. I don't think economists know how anything could be achieved either, but they pretend. It's the thing, they construct a model and they go on TV shows and sound like an expert. That's the definition of economist. How did being a mother, becoming a mother change you as a human being, would you say? Man, I think it kind of changed everything and it's still changing me a lot. It's actually changing me more right now in this moment than it was before. Like today, like this? Just like in the most recent months and stuff. Can you elucidate that, how change, like when you wake up in the morning and you look at yourself, it's again, which, who are you? How have you become different, would you say? I think it's just really reorienting my priorities. And at first I was really fighting against that because I somehow felt it was like a failure of feminism or something. Like I felt like it was like bad if like my kids started mattering more than my work. And then like more recently I started sort of analyzing that thought in myself and being like, that's also kind of a construct. It's like, we've just devalued motherhood so much in our culture that like, I feel guilty for caring about my kids more than I care about my work. So feminism includes breaking out of whatever the construct is. So just continually breaking, it's like freedom empower you to be free. And that means... But it also, but like being a mother, like I'm so much more creative. Like I cannot believe the massive amount of brain growth that I am. Why do you think that is? Just cause like the stakes are higher somehow? I think it's like, it's just so trippy watching consciousness emerge. It's just like, it's like going on a crazy journey or something. It's like the craziest science fiction novel you could ever read. It's just so crazy watching consciousness come into being. And then at the same time, like you're forced to value your time so much. Like when I have creative time now, it's so sacred. I need to like be really fricking on it. But the other thing is that I used to just be like a cynic and I used to just wanna... Like my last album was called Miss Anthropocene and it was like this like, it was like a study in villainy or like it was like, well, what if we have, instead of the old gods, we have like new gods and it's like Miss Anthropocene is like misanthrope like and Anthropocene, which is like the, you know, like and she's the goddess of climate change or whatever. And she's like destroying the world. And it was just like, it was like dark and it was like a study in villainy. And it was sort of just like, like I used to like have no problem just making cynical, angry, scary art. And not that there's anything wrong with that, but I think having kids just makes you such an optimist. It just inherently makes you wanna be an optimist so bad that like I feel more responsibility to make more optimistic things. And I get a lot of shit for it because everyone's like, oh, you're so privileged. Stop talking about like pie in the sky, stupid concepts and focus on like the now. But it's like, I think if we don't ideate about futures that could be good, we won't be able to get them. If everything is Blade Runner, then we're gonna end up with Blade Runner. It's like, as we said earlier, life imitates art. Like life really does imitate art. And so we really need more protopian or utopian art. I think this is incredibly essential for the future of humanity. And I think the current discourse where that's seen as a thinking about protopia or utopia is seen as a dismissal of the problems that we currently have. I think that is an incorrect mindset. And like having kids just makes me wanna imagine amazing futures that like maybe I won't be able to build, but they will be able to build if they want to. Yeah, it does seem like ideation is a precursor to creation. So you have to imagine it in order to be able to build it. And there is a sad thing about human nature that somehow a cynical view of the world is seen as a insightful view. You know, cynicism is often confused for insight, which is sad to see. And optimism is confused for naivete. Yes, yes. Like you don't, you're blinded by your, maybe your privilege or whatever. You're blinded by something, but you're certainly blinded. That's sad, that's sad to see because it seems like the optimists are the ones that create our future. They're the ones that build. In order to build the crazy thing, you have to be optimistic. You have to be either stupid or excited or passionate or mad enough to actually believe that it can be built. And those are the people that built it. My favorite quote of all time is from Star Wars, Episode 8, which I know everyone hates. Do you like Star Wars, Episode 8? No, yeah, probably I would say I would probably hate it, yeah. I don't have strong feelings about it. Let me backtrack. I don't have strong feelings about Star Wars. I'm a Tolkien person. I'm more into dragons and orcs and ogres. Yeah, I mean, Tolkien forever. I really want to have one more son and call him, I thought Tao Tecno Tolkien would be cool. It's a lot of T's, I like it. Yeah, and well, and Tao is six, two, eight, two pi. Yeah, Tao Tecno, yeah, yeah, yeah. And then techno is obviously the best genre of music, but also like technocracy. It just sounds really good. Yeah, that's right, and techno Tolkien, Tao Tecno Tolkien. That's a good, that's it. Tao Tecno Tolkien, but Star Wars, Episode 8, I know a lot of people have issues with it. Personally, on the record, I think it's the best Star Wars film. You're starting trouble today. Yeah, but don't kill what you hate, save what you love. Don't kill what you hate. Don't kill what you hate, save what you love. And I think we're, in society right now, we're in a diagnosis mode. We're just diagnosing and diagnosing and diagnosing, and we're trying to kill what we hate, and we're not trying to save what we love enough. And there's this Buckminster Fuller quote, which I'm gonna butcher, because I don't remember it correctly, but it's something along the lines of, don't try to destroy the old bad models, render them obsolete with better models. Maybe we don't need to destroy the oil industry. Maybe we just create a great new battery technology and sustainable transport, and just make it economically unreasonable to still continue to rely on fossil fuels. It's like, don't kill what you hate, save what you love. Make new things and just render the old things unusable. It's like if the college debt is so bad, and universities are so expensive, and I feel like education is becoming obsolete. I feel like we could completely revolutionize education, and we could make it free. And it's like, you look at JSTOR, and you have to pay to get all the studies and everything. What if we created a DAO that bought JSTOR, or we created a DAO that was funding studies, and those studies were open source, or free for everyone. And what if we just open sourced education and decentralized education and made it free, and all research was on the internet, and all the outcomes of studies were on the internet, and no one has student debt, and you just take tests when you apply for a job, and if you're qualified, then you can work there. This is just like, I don't know how anything works. I'm just randomly ranting, but. I like the humility. You gotta think from just basic first principles. What is the problem? What's broken? What are some ideas? That's it. And get excited about those ideas, and share your excitement, and don't tear each other down. It's just when you kill things, you often end up killing yourself. Like war is not a one sided, like you're not gonna go in and just kill them, like you're gonna get stabbed. It's like, and I think when I talk about this nexus point of that we're in this point in society where we're switching to intelligent design, I think part of our switch to intelligent design is that we need to choose nonviolence. And we need to, like, I think we can choose to start, I don't think we can eradicate violence from our species, because I think we need it a little bit, but I think we can choose to really reorient our primitive brains that are fighting over scarcity, and that are so attack oriented, and move into, we can optimize for creativity and building. Yeah, it's interesting to think how that happens, so some of it is just education, some of it is living life and introspecting your own mind, and trying to live up to the better angels of your nature for each one of us, all those kinds of things at scale. That's how we can sort of start to minimize the amount of destructive war in our world, and that's, to me, probably you're the same, technology is a really promising way to do that. Like, social media should be a really promising way to do that, it's a way we connect. I, you know, for the most part, I really enjoy social media. I just know all the negative stuff. I don't engage with any of the negative stuff. Just not even, like, by blocking or any of that kind of stuff, but just not letting it enter my mind. Like, just, like, when somebody says something negative, I see it, I immediately think positive thoughts about them, and I just forget they exist after that. Just move on, because, like, that negative energy, if I return the negative energy, they're going to get excited in a negative way right back, and it's just this kind of vicious cycle. But you would think technology would assist us in this process of letting go, of not taking things personally, of not engaging in the negativity, but unfortunately, social media profits from the negativity, so the current models. I mean, social media is like a gun. Like, you should take a course before you use it. Like, it's like, this is what I mean, like, when I say reprogram the human computer. Like, in school, you should learn about how social media optimizes to, you know, raise your cortisol levels and make you angry and crazy and stressed, and, like, you should learn how to have hygiene about how you use social media. But, so you can, yeah, choose not to focus on the negative stuff, but I don't know. I'm not sure social media should, I guess it should exist. I'm not sure. I mean, we're in the messy, it's the experimental phase. Like, we're working it out. Yeah, it's the early days. I don't even know, when you say social media, I don't know what that even means. We're in the very early days. I think social media is just basic human connection in the digital realm, and that, I think it should exist, but there's so many ways to do it in a bad way. There's so many ways to do it in a good way. There's all discussions of all the same human rights. We talk about freedom of speech. We talk about sort of violence in the space of digital media. We talk about hate speech. We talk about all these things that we had to figure out back in the day in the physical space. We're now figuring out in the digital space, and it's like baby stages. When the printing press came out, it was like pure chaos for a minute, you know? It's like when you inject, when there's a massive information injection into the general population, there's just gonna be, I feel like the printing press, I don't have the years, but it was like printing press came out, shit got really fucking bad for a minute, but then we got the enlightenment. And so it's like, I think we're in, this is like the second coming of the printing press. We're probably gonna have some shitty times for a minute, and then we're gonna have recalibrate to have a better understanding of how we consume media and how we deliver media. Speaking of programming the human computer, you mentioned Baby X. So there's this young consciousness coming to be, came from a cell. Like that whole thing doesn't even make sense. It came from DNA. Yeah. And then there's this baby computer that just like grows and grows and grows and grows, and now there's a conscious being with extremely impressive cognitive capabilities with, Have you met him? Yes, yeah. Yeah. He's actually really smart. He's really smart. Yeah. He's weird. Yeah. Or a baby. He does. I don't, I haven't. I don't know a lot of other babies, but he seems to be smart. Zach, I don't hang out with babies often, but this baby was very impressive. He does a lot of pranks and stuff. Oh, so he's like. Like he'll like give you a treat and then take it away and laugh and like stuff like that. So he's like a chess player. So here's a cognitive sort of, there's a computer being programmed. So he's taking in the environment, interacting with a specific set of humans. How would you, first of all, what is it? What, let me ask. I want to ask how do you program this computer? And also how do you make sense of that there's a conscious being right there that wasn't there before? It's giving me a lot of crisis thoughts. I'm thinking really hard. I think that's part of the reason it's like, I'm struggling to focus on art and stuff right now. Cause baby X is becoming conscious and like my it's just reorienting my brain. Like my brain is suddenly totally shifting of like, oh shit, like the way we raise children. Like, I hate all the baby books and everything. I hate them. Like they're, oh, the art is so bad. And like all this stuff, everything about all the aesthetics. And like, I'm just like, ah, like this is so. The programming languages we're using to program these baby computers isn't good. Yeah, like I'm thinking, and I, not that I have like good answers or know what to do, but I'm just thinking really, really hard about it. I, we recently watched Totoro with him, Studio Ghibli. And it's just like a fantastic film. And he like responded to, I know you're not supposed to show baby screens too much, but like, I think it's the most sort of like, I feel like it's the highest art baby content. Like it really speaks, there's almost no talking in it. It's really simple. Although all the dialogue is super, super, super simple, you know, and it's like a one to three year old can like really connect with it. Like it feels like it's almost aimed at like a one to three year old, but it's like great art and it's so imaginative and it's so beautiful. And like the first time I showed it to him, he was just like so invested in it, unlike I've ever, unlike anything else I'd ever shown him. Like he was just like crying when they cry and laughing when they laugh, like just like having this roller coaster of like emotions, like, and he learned a bunch of words. Like he was, and he started saying Totoro and started just saying all this stuff after watching Totoro, and he wants to watch it all the time. And I was like, man, why isn't there an industry of this? Like why aren't our best artists focusing on making art like for the birth of consciousness? Like, and that's one of the things I've been thinking I really wanna start doing. You know, I don't wanna speak before I do things too much, but like, I'm just like ages one to three, like we should be putting so much effort into that. And the other thing about Totoro is it's like, it's like better for the environment because adults love Totoro. It's such good art that everyone loves it. Like I still have all my old Totoro merch from when I was a kid. Like I literally have the most ragged old Totoro merch. Like everybody loves it, everybody keeps it. It's like, why does the art we have for babies need to suck and be not accessible to adults and then just be thrown out when, you know, they age out of it? Like, it's like, I don't know. I don't have like a fully formed thought here, but this is just something I've been thinking about a lot is like, how do we like, how do we have more Totoroesque content? Like how do we have more content like this that like is universal and everybody loves, but is like really geared to an emerging consciousness? Emerging consciousness in the first like three years of life that so much turmoil, so much evolution of mind is happening. It seems like a crucial time. Would you say to make it not suck, do you think of basically treating a child like they have the capacity to have the brilliance of an adult or even beyond that? Is that how you think of that mind or? No, cause they still, they like it when you talk weird and stuff. Like they respond better to, cause even they can imitate better when your voice is higher. Like people say like, oh, don't do baby talk. But it's like, when your voice is higher, it's closer to something they can imitate. So they like, like the baby talk actually kind of works. Like it helps them learn to communicate. I've found it to be more effective with learning words and stuff. But like, you're not speaking down to them. Like do they have the capacity\",\n          \"The following is a conversation with Sean Carroll. He's a theoretical physicist at Caltech specializing in quantum mechanics, gravity, and cosmology. He's the author of several popular books, one on the arrow of time called From Eternity to Here, one on the Higgs boson called Particle at the End of the Universe, and one on science and philosophy called The Big Picture on the Origins of Life, Meaning, and the Universe Itself. He has an upcoming book on quantum mechanics that you can preorder now called Something Deeply Hidden. He writes one of my favorite blogs on his website, preposterousuniverse.com. I recommend clicking on the Greatest Hits link that lists accessible, interesting posts on the arrow of time, dark matter, dark energy, the Big Bang, general relativity, string theory, quantum mechanics, and the big meta questions about the philosophy of science, God, ethics, politics, academia, and much, much more. Finally, and perhaps most famously, he's the host of a podcast called Mindscape that you should subscribe to and support on Patreon. Along with the Joe Rogan experience, Sam Harris's Making Sense, and Dan Carlin's Hardcore History, Sean's Mindscape podcast is one of my favorite ways to learn new ideas or explore different perspectives and ideas that I thought I understood. It was truly an honor to meet and spend a couple hours with Sean. It's a bit heartbreaking to say that for the first time ever, the audio recorder for this podcast died in the middle of our conversation. There's technical reasons for this, having to do with phantom power that I now understand and will avoid. It took me one hour to notice and fix the problem. So, much like the universe is 68% dark energy, roughly the same amount from this conversation was lost, except in the memories of the two people involved and in my notes. I'm sure we'll talk again and continue this conversation on this podcast or on Sean's. And of course, I look forward to it. This is the Artificial Intelligence podcast. If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube, iTunes, support it on Patreon, or simply connect with me on Twitter at Lex Friedman. And now, here's my conversation with Sean Carroll. What do you think is more interesting and impactful, understanding how the universe works at a fundamental level or understanding how the human mind works? You know, of course this is a crazy, meaningless, unanswerable question in some sense, because they're both very interesting and there's no absolute scale of interestingness that we can rate them on. There's a glib answer that says the human brain is part of the universe, right? And therefore, understanding the universe is more fundamental than understanding the human brain. But do you really believe that once we understand the fundamental way the universe works at the particle level, the forces, we would be able to understand how the mind works? No, certainly not. We cannot understand how ice cream works just from understanding how particles work, right? So I'm a big believer in emergence. I'm a big believer that there are different ways of talking about the world beyond just the most fundamental microscopic one. You know, when we talk about tables and chairs and planets and people, we're not talking the language of particle physics and cosmology. So, but understanding the universe, you didn't say just at the most fundamental level, right? So understanding the universe at all levels is part of that. I do think, you know, to be a little bit more fair to the question, there probably are general principles of complexity, biology, information processing, memory, knowledge, creativity that go beyond just the human brain, right? And maybe one could count understanding those as part of understanding the universe. The human brain, as far as we know, is the most complex thing in the universe. So there's, it's certainly absurd to think that by understanding the fundamental laws of particle physics, you get any direct insight on how the brain works. But then there's this step from the fundamentals of particle physics to information processing, which a lot of physicists and philosophers may be a little bit carelessly take when they talk about artificial intelligence. Do you think of the universe as a kind of a computational device? No, to be like, the honest answer there is no. There's a sense in which the universe processes information, clearly. There's a sense in which the universe is like a computer, clearly. But in some sense, I think, I tried to say this once on my blog and no one agreed with me, but the universe is more like a computation than a computer because the universe happens once. A computer is a general purpose machine, right? That you can ask it different questions, even a pocket calculator, right? And it's set up to answer certain kinds of questions. The universe isn't that. So information processing happens in the universe, but it's not what the universe is. And I know your MIT colleague, Seth Lloyd, feels very differently about this, right? Well, you're thinking of the universe as a closed system. I am. So what makes a computer more like a PC, like a computing machine is that there's a human that every once comes up to it and moves the mouse around. So input. Gives it input. Gives it input. And that's why you're saying it's just a computation, a deterministic thing that's just unrolling. But the immense complexity of it is nevertheless like processing. There's a state and then it changes with good rules. And there's a sense for a lot of people that if the brain operates, the human brain operates within that world, then it's simply just a small subset of that. And so there's no reason we can't build arbitrarily great intelligences. Yeah. Do you think of intelligence in this way? Intelligence is tricky. I don't have a definition of it offhand. So I remember this panel discussion that I saw on YouTube. I wasn't there, but Seth Lloyd was on the panel. And so was Martin Rees, the famous astrophysicist. And Seth gave his shtick for why the universe is a computer and explained this. And Martin Rees said, so what is not a computer? And Seth was like, oh, that's a good question. I'm not sure. Because if you have a sufficiently broad definition of what a computer is, then everything is, right? And the simile or the analogy gains force when it excludes some things. You know, is the moon going around the earth performing a computation? I can come up with definitions in which the answer is yes, but it's not a very useful computation. I think that it's absolutely helpful to think about the universe in certain situations, certain contexts, as an information processing device. I'm even guilty of writing a paper called Quantum Circuit Cosmology, where we modeled the whole universe as a quantum circuit. As a circuit. As a circuit, yeah. With qubits kind of thing? With qubits basically, right, yeah. So, and qubits becoming more and more entangled. So do we wanna digress a little bit? Let's do it. It's kind of fun. So here's a mystery about the universe that is so deep and profound that nobody talks about it. Space expands, right? And we talk about, in a certain region of space, a certain number of degrees of freedom, a certain number of ways that the quantum fields and the particles in that region can arrange themselves. That number of degrees of freedom in a region of space is arguably finite. We actually don't know how many there are, but there's a very good argument that says it's a finite number. So as the universe expands and space gets bigger, are there more degrees of freedom? If it's an infinite number, it doesn't really matter. Infinity times two is still infinity. But if it's a finite number, then there's more space, so there's more degrees of freedom. So where did they come from? That would mean the universe is not a closed system. There's more degrees of freedom popping into existence. So what we suggested was that there are more degrees of freedom, and it's not that they're not there to start, but they're not entangled to start. So the universe that you and I know of, the three dimensions around us that we see, we said those are the entangled degrees of freedom making up space time. And as the universe expands, there are a whole bunch of qubits in their zero state that become entangled with the rest of space time through the action of these quantum circuits. So what does it mean that there's now more degrees of freedom as they become more entangled? Yeah, so. As the universe expands. That's right, so there's more and more degrees of freedom that are entangled, that are playing part, playing the role of part of the entangled space time structure. So the basic, the underlying philosophy is that space time itself arises from the entanglement of some fundamental quantum degrees of freedom. Wow, okay, so at which point is most of the entanglement happening? Are we talking about close to the Big Bang? Are we talking about throughout the time of the life? Throughout history, yeah. So the idea is that at the Big Bang, almost all the degrees of freedom that the universe could have were there, but they were unentangled with anything else. And that's a reflection of the fact that the Big Bang had a low entropy. It was a very simple, very small place. And as space expands, more and more degrees of freedom become entangled with the rest of the world. Well, I have to ask John Carroll, what do you think of the thought experiment from Nick Bostrom that we're living in a simulation? So I think, let me contextualize that a little bit more. I think people don't actually take this thought experiments. I think it's quite interesting. It's not very useful, but it's quite interesting. From the perspective of AI, a lot of the learning that can be done usually happens in simulation from artificial examples. And so it's a constructive question to ask, how difficult is our real world to simulate? Right. Which is kind of a dual part of, if we're living in a simulation and somebody built that simulation, if you were to try to do it yourself, how hard would it be? So obviously we could be living in a simulation. If you just want the physical possibility, then I completely agree that it's physically possible. I don't think that we actually are. So take this one piece of data into consideration. You know, we live in a big universe, okay? There's two trillion galaxies in our observable universe with 200 billion stars in each galaxy, et cetera. It would seem to be a waste of resources to have a universe that big going on just to do a simulation. So in other words, I want to be a good Bayesian. I want to ask under this hypothesis, what do I expect to see? So the first thing I would say is I wouldn't expect to see a universe that was that big, okay? The second thing is I wouldn't expect the resolution of the universe to be as good as it is. So it's always possible that if our superhuman simulators only have finite resources, that they don't render the entire universe, right? That the part that is out there, the two trillion galaxies, isn't actually being simulated fully, okay? But then the obvious extrapolation of that is that only I am being simulated fully. Like the rest of you are just non player characters, right? I'm the only thing that is real. The rest of you are just chat bots. Beyond this wall, I see the wall, but there is literally nothing on the other side of the wall. That is sort of the Bayesian prediction. That's what it would be like to do an efficient simulation of me. So like none of that seems quite realistic. I don't see, I hear the argument that it's just possible and easy to simulate lots of things. I don't see any evidence from what we know about our universe that we look like a simulated universe. Now, maybe you can say, well, we don't know what it would look like, but that's just abandoning your Bayesian responsibilities. Like your job is to say under this theory, here's what you would expect to see. Yeah, so certainly if you think about simulation as a thing that's like a video game where only a small subset is being rendered. But say the entire, all the laws of physics, the entire closed system of the quote unquote universe, it had a creator. Yeah, it's always possible. Right, so that's not useful to think about when you're thinking about physics. The way Nick Bostrom phrases it, if it's possible to simulate a universe, eventually we'll do it. Right. You can use that by the way for a lot of things. Well, yeah. But I guess the question is, how hard is it to create a universe? I wrote a little blog post about this and maybe I'm missing something, but there's an argument that says not only that it might be possible to simulate a universe, but probably if you imagine that you actually attribute consciousness and agency to the little things that we're simulating, to our little artificial beings, there's probably a lot more of them than there are ordinary organic beings in the universe or there will be in the future, right? So there's an argument that not only is being a simulation possible, it's probable because in the space of all living consciousnesses, most of them are being simulated, right? Most of them are not at the top level. I think that argument must be wrong because it follows from that argument that, if we're simulated, but we can also simulate other things, well, but if we can simulate other things, they can simulate other things, right? If we give them enough power and resolution and ultimately we'll reach a bottom because the laws of physics in our universe have a bottom, we're made of atoms and so forth, so there will be the cheapest possible simulations. And if you believe the original argument, you should conclude that we should be in the cheapest possible simulation because that's where most people are. But we don't look like that. It doesn't look at all like we're at the edge of resolution, that we're 16 bit things. It seems much easier to make much lower level things than we are. And also, I questioned the whole approach to the anthropic principle that says we are typical observers in the universe. I think that that's not actually, I think that there's a lot of selection that we can do that we're typical within things we already know, but not typical within all of the universe. So do you think there's intelligent life, however you would like to define intelligent life, out there in the universe? My guess is that there is not intelligent life in the observable universe other than us, simply on the basis of the fact that the likely number of other intelligent species in the observable universe, there's two likely numbers, zero or billions. And if there had been billions, you would have noticed already. For there to be literally like a small number, like, you know, Star Trek, there's a dozen intelligent civilizations in our galaxy, but not a billion, that's weird. That's sort of bizarre to me. It's easy for me to imagine that there are zero others because there's just a big bottleneck to making multicellular life or technological life or whatever. It's very hard for me to imagine that there's a whole bunch out there that have somehow remained hidden from us. The question I'd like to ask is what would intelligent life look like? What I mean by that question and where it's going is what if intelligent life is just in some very big ways different than the one that has on Earth? That there's all kinds of intelligent life that operates at different scales of both size and temporal. Right, that's a great possibility because I think we should be humble about what intelligence is, what life is. We don't even agree on what life is, much less what intelligent life is, right? So that's an argument for humility, saying there could be intelligent life of a very different character, right? Like you could imagine the dolphins are intelligent but never invent space travel because they live in the ocean and they don't have thumbs, right? So they never invent technology, they never invent smelting. Maybe the universe is full of intelligent species that just don't make technology, right? That's compatible with the data, I think. And I think maybe what you're pointing at is even more out there versions of intelligence, intelligence in intermolecular clouds or on the surface of a neutron star or in between the galaxies in giant things where the equivalent of a heartbeat is 100 million years. On the one hand, yes, we should be very open minded about those things. On the other hand, all of us share the same laws of physics. There might be something about the laws of physics, even though we don't currently know exactly what that thing would be, that makes meters and years the right length and timescales for intelligent life. Maybe not, but we're made of atoms, atoms have a certain size, we orbit stars or stars have a certain lifetime. It's not impossible to me that there's a sweet spot for intelligent life that we find ourselves in. So I'm open minded either way, I'm open minded either being humble and there's all sorts of different kinds of life or no, there's a reason we just don't know it yet why life like ours is the kind of life that's out there. Yeah, I'm of two minds too, but I often wonder if our brains is just designed to quite obviously to operate and see the world in these timescales and we're almost blind and the tools we've created for detecting things are blind to the kind of observation needed to see intelligent life at other scales. Well, I'm totally open to that, but so here's another argument I would make, we have looked for intelligent life, but we've looked at for it in the dumbest way we can, by turning radio telescopes to the sky. And why in the world would a super advanced civilization randomly beam out radio signals wastefully in all directions into the universe? That just doesn't make any sense, especially because in order to think that you would actually contact another civilization, you would have to do it forever, you have to keep doing it for millions of years, that sounds like a waste of resources. If you thought that there were other solar systems with planets around them, where maybe intelligent life didn't yet exist, but might someday, you wouldn't try to talk to it with radio waves, you would send a spacecraft out there and you would park it around there and it would be like, from our point of view, it'd be like 2001, where there was a monolith. Monolith. There could be an artifact, in fact, the other way works also, right? There could be artifacts in our solar system that have been put there by other technologically advanced civilizations and that's how we will eventually contact them. We just haven't explored the solar system well enough yet to find them. The reason why we don't think about that is because we're young and impatient, right? Like, it would take more than my lifetime to actually send something to another star system and wait for it and then come back. So, but if we start thinking on hundreds of thousands of years or million year time scales, that's clearly the right thing to do. Are you excited by the thing that Elon Musk is doing with SpaceX in general? Space, but the idea of space exploration, even though your, or your species is young and impatient? Yeah. No, I do think that space travel is crucially important, long term. Even to other star systems. And I think that many people overestimate the difficulty because they say, look, if you travel 1% the speed of light to another star system, we'll be dead before we get there, right? And I think that it's much easier. And therefore, when they write their science fiction stories, they imagine we'd go faster than the speed of light because otherwise they're too impatient, right? We're not gonna go faster than the speed of light, but we could easily imagine that the human lifespan gets extended to thousands of years. And once you do that, then the stars are much closer effectively, right? And then what's a hundred year trip, right? So I think that that's gonna be the future, the far future, not my lifetime once again, but baby steps. Unless your lifetime gets extended. Well, it's in a race against time, right? A friend of mine who actually thinks about these things said, you know, you and I are gonna die, but I don't know about our grandchildren. That's, I don't know, predicting the future is hard, but that's at least a plausible scenario. And so, yeah, no, I think that as we discussed earlier, there are threats to the earth, known and unknown, right? Having spread humanity and biology elsewhere is a really important longterm goal. What kind of questions can science not currently answer, but might soon? When you think about the problems and the mysteries before us that may be within reach of science. I think an obvious one is the origin of life. We don't know how that happened. There's a difficulty in knowing how it happened historically actually, you know, literally on earth, but starting life from non life is something I kind of think we're close to, right? We're really. You really think so? Like how difficult is it to start life? Well, I've talked to people, including on the podcast about this. You know, life requires three things. Life as we know it. So there's a difference with life, which who knows what it is, and life as we know it, which we can talk about with some intelligence. So life as we know it requires compartmentalization. You need like a little membrane around your cell. Metabolism, you need to take in food and eat it and let that make you do things. And then replication, okay? So you need to have some information about who you are that you pass down to future generations. In the lab, compartmentalization seems pretty easy. Not hard to make lipid bilayers that come into little cellular walls pretty easily. Metabolism and replication are hard, but replication we're close to. People have made RNA like molecules in the lab that I think the state of the art is, they're not able to make one molecule that reproduces itself, but they're able to make two molecules that reproduce each other. So that's okay. That's pretty close. Metabolism is harder, believe it or not, even though it's sort of the most obvious thing, but you want some sort of controlled metabolism and the actual cellular machinery in our bodies is quite complicated. It's hard to see it just popping into existence all by itself. It probably took a while, but we're making progress. And in fact, I don't think we're spending nearly enough money on it. If I were the NSF, I would flood this area with money because it would change our view of the world if we could actually make life in the lab and understand how it was made originally here on earth. And I'm sure it'd have some ripple effects that help cure disease and so on. I mean, just that understanding. So synthetic biology is a wonderful big frontier where we're making cells. Right now, the best way to do that is to borrow heavily from existing biology, right? Well, Craig Venter several years ago created an artificial cell, but all he did was, not all he did, it was a tremendous accomplishment, but all he did was take out the DNA from a cell and put in entirely new DNA and let it boot up and go. What about the leap to creating intelligent life on earth? Yeah. Again, we define intelligence, of course, but let's just even say Homo sapiens, the modern intelligence in our human brain. Do you have a sense of what's involved in that leap and how big of a leap that is? So AI would count in this, or do you really want life? Do you want really an organism in some sense? AI would count, I think. Okay. Yeah, of course, of course AI would count. Well, let's say artificial consciousness, right? So I do not think we are on the threshold of creating artificial consciousness. I think it's possible. I'm not, again, very educated about how close we are, but my impression is not that we're really close because we understand how little we understand of consciousness and what it is. So if we don't have any idea what it is, it's hard to imagine we're on the threshold of making it ourselves. But it's doable, it's possible. I don't see any obstacles in principle. So yeah, I would hold out some interest in that happening eventually. I think in general, consciousness, I think we would be just surprised how easy consciousness is once we create intelligence. I think consciousness is a thing that's just something we all fake. Well, good. No, actually, I like this idea that in fact, consciousness is way less mysterious than we think because we're all at every time, at every moment, less conscious than we think we are, right? We can fool things. And I think that plus the idea that you not only have artificial intelligent systems, but you put them in a body, right, give them a robot body, that will help the faking a lot. Yeah, I think creating consciousness in artificial consciousness is as simple as asking a Roomba to say, I'm conscious, and refusing to be talked out of it. Could be, it could be. And I mean, I'm almost being silly, but that's what we do. That's what we do with each other. This is the kind of, that consciousness is also a social construct. And a lot of our ideas of intelligence is a social construct. And so reaching that bar involves something that's beyond, that doesn't necessarily involve the fundamental understanding of how you go from electrons to neurons to cognition. No, actually, I think that is an extremely good point. And in fact, what it suggests is, so yeah, you referred to Kate Darling, who I had on the podcast, and who does these experiments with very simple robots, but they look like animals, and they can look like they're experiencing pain, and we human beings react very negatively to these little robots looking like they're experiencing pain. And what you wanna say is, yeah, but they're just robots. It's not really pain, right? It's just some electrons going around. But then you realize, you and I are just electrons going around, and that's what pain is also. And so what I would have an easy time imagining is that there is a spectrum between these simple little robots that Kate works with and a human being, where there are things that sort of by some strict definition, Turing test level thing are not conscious, but nevertheless walk and talk like they're conscious. And it could be that the future is, I mean, Siri is close, right? And so it might be the future has a lot more agents like that. And in fact, rather than someday going, aha, we have consciousness, we'll just creep up on it with more and more accurate reflections of what we expect. And in the future, maybe the present, for example, we haven't met before, and you're basically assuming that I'm human as it's a high probability at this time because the yeah, but in the future, there might be question marks around that, right? Yeah, no, absolutely. Certainly videos are almost to the point where you shouldn't trust them already. Photos you can't trust, right? Videos is easier to trust, but we're getting worse that, we're getting better at faking them, right? Yeah, so physical embodied people, what's so hard about faking that? So this is very depressing, this conversation we're having right now. So I mean, To me, it's exciting. To me, you're doing it. So it's exciting to you, but it's a sobering thought. We're very bad, right? At imagining what the next 50 years are gonna be like when we're in the middle of a phase transition as we are right now. Yeah, and I, in general, I'm not blind to all the threats. I am excited by the power of technology to solve, to protect us against the threats as they evolve. I'm not as much as Steven Pinker optimistic about the world, but in everything I've seen, all of the brilliant people in the world that I've met are good people. So the army of the good in terms of the development of technology is large. Okay, you're way more optimistic than I am. I think that goodness and badness are equally distributed among intelligent and unintelligent people. I don't see much of a correlation there. Interesting. Neither of us have proof. Yeah, exactly. Again, opinions are free, right? Nor definitions of good and evil. We come without definitions or without data opinions. So what kind of questions can science not currently answer and may never be able to answer in your view? Well, the obvious one is what is good and bad? What is right and wrong? I think that there are questions that, science tells us what happens, what the world is and what it does. It doesn't say what the world should do or what we should do, because we're part of the world. But we are part of the world and we have the ability to feel like something's right, something's wrong. And to make a very long story very short, I think that the idea of moral philosophy is systematizing our intuitions of what is right and what is wrong. And science might be able to predict ahead of time what we will do, but it won't ever be able to judge whether we should have done it or not. So, you're kind of unique in terms of scientists. Listen, it doesn't have to do with podcasts, but even just reaching out, I think you referred to as sort of doing interdisciplinary science. So you reach out and talk to people that are outside of your discipline, which I always hope that's what science was for. In fact, I was a little disillusioned when I realized that academia is very siloed. Yeah. And so the question is, how, at your own level, how do you prepare for these conversations? How do you think about these conversations? How do you open your mind enough to have these conversations? And it may be a little bit broader, how can you advise other scientists to have these kinds of conversations? Not at the podcast, the fact that you're doing a podcast is awesome, other people get to hear them, but it's also good to have it without mics in general. It's a good question, but a tough one to answer. I think about a guy I know who's a personal trainer, and he was asked on a podcast, how do we psych ourselves up to do a workout? How do we make that discipline to go and work out? And he's like, why are you asking me? I can't stop working out. I don't need to psych myself up. So, and likewise, he asked me, how do you get to have interdisciplinary conversations on all sorts of different things, all sorts of different people? I'm like, that's what makes me go, right? Like that's, I couldn't stop doing that. I did that long before any of them were recorded. In fact, a lot of the motivation for starting recording it was making sure I would read all these books that I had purchased, right? Like all these books I wanted to read, not enough time to read them. And now if I have the motivation, cause I'm gonna interview Pat Churchland, I'm gonna finally read her book. You know, and it's absolutely true that academia is extraordinarily siloed, right? We don't talk to people. We rarely do. And in fact, when we do, it's punished. You know, like the people who do it successfully generally first became very successful within their little siloed discipline. And only then did they start expanding out. If you're a young person, you know, I have graduate students. I try to be very, very candid with them about this, that it's, you know, most graduate students are to not become faculty members, right? It's a tough road. And so live the life you wanna live, but do it with your eyes open about what it does to your job chances. And the more broad you are and the less time you spend hyper specializing in your field, the lower your job chances are. That's just an academic reality. It's terrible, I don't like it, but it's a reality. And for some people, that's fine. Like there's plenty of people who are wonderful scientists who have zero interest in branching out and talking to things, to anyone outside their field. But it is disillusioning to me. Some of the, you know, romantic notion I had of the intellectual academic life is belied by the reality of it. The idea that we should reach out beyond our discipline and that is a positive good is just so rare in universities that it may as well not exist at all. But that said, even though you're saying you're doing it like the personal trainer, because you just can't help it, you're also an inspiration to others. Like I could speak for myself. You know, I also have a career I'm thinking about, right? And without your podcast, I may have not have been doing this at all, right? So it makes me realize that these kinds of conversations is kind of what science is about in many ways. The reason we write papers, this exchange of ideas, is it's much harder to do interdisciplinary papers, I would say. And conversations are easier. So conversations is the beginning. And in the field of AI, it's obvious that we should think outside of pure computer vision competitions on a particular data sets. We should think about the broader impact of how this can be, you know, reaching out to physics, to psychology, to neuroscience and having these conversations so that you're an inspiration. And so never know how the world changes. I mean, the fact that this stuff is out there and I've a huge number of people come up to me, grad students, really loving the podcast, inspired by it. And they will probably have that, they'll be ripple effects when they become faculty and so on and so on. We can end on a balance between pessimism and optimism. And Sean, thank you so much for talking to me, it was awesome. No, Lex, thank you very much for this conversation.

            "['as part of mit course 6s099 artificial general intelligence ive gotten the chance to sit down with max tegmark he is a professor here at mit hes a physicist spent a large part of his career studying the mysteries of our cosmological universe but hes also studied and delved into the beneficial possibilities and the existential risks of artificial intelligence amongst many other things he is the cofounder of the future of life institute author of two books both of which i highly recommend first our mathematical universe second is life 30 hes truly an out of the box thinker and a fun personality so i really enjoy talking to him if youd like to see more of these videos in the future please subscribe and also click the little bell icon to make sure you dont miss any videos also twitter linkedin agimitedu if you wanna watch other lectures or conversations like this one better yet go read maxs book life 30 chapter seven on goals is my favorite its really where philosophy and engineering come together and it opens with a quote by dostoevsky the mystery of human existence lies not in just staying alive but in finding something to live for lastly i believe that every failure rewards us with an opportunity to learn and in that sense ive been very fortunate to fail in so many new and exciting ways and this conversation was no different ive learned about something called radio frequency interference rfi look it up apparently music and conversations from local radio stations can bleed into the audio that youre recording in such a way that it almost completely ruins that audio its an exceptionally difficult sound source to remove so ive gotten the opportunity to learn how to avoid rfi in the future during recording sessions ive also gotten the opportunity to learn how to use adobe audition and izotope rx 6 to do some noise some audio repair of course this is an exceptionally difficult noise to remove i am an engineer im not an audio engineer neither is anybody else in our group but we did our best nevertheless i thank you for your patience and i hope youre still able to enjoy this conversation do you think theres intelligent life out there in the universe lets open up with an easy question i have a minority view here actually when i give public lectures i often ask for a show of hands who thinks theres intelligent life out there somewhere else and almost everyone put their hands up and when i ask why theyll be like oh theres so many galaxies out there theres gotta be but im a numbers nerd right so when you look more carefully at it its not so clear at all when we talk about our universe first of all we dont mean all of space we actually mean i dont know you can throw me the universe if you want its behind you there its we simply mean the spherical region of space from which light has a time to reach us so far during the 148 billion year 138 billion years since our big bang theres more space here but this is what we call a universe because thats all we have access to so is there intelligent life here thats gotten to the point of building telescopes and computers my guess is no actually the probability of it happening on any given planet is some number we dont know what it is and what we do know is that the number cant be super high because theres over a billion earth like planets in the milky way galaxy alone many of which are billions of years older than earth and aside from some ufo believers there isnt much evidence that any superduran civilization has come here at all and so thats the famous fermi paradox right and then if you work the numbers what you find is that if you have no clue what the probability is of getting life on a given planet so it could be 10 to the minus 10 10 to the minus 20 or 10 to the minus two or any power of 10 is sort of equally likely if you wanna be really open minded that translates into it being equally likely that our nearest neighbor is 10 to the 16 meters away 10 to the 17 meters away 10 to the 18 by the time you get much less than 10 to the 16 already we pretty much know there is nothing else that close and when you get beyond 10 because they would have discovered us yeah they would have been discovered as long ago or if theyre really close we would have probably noted some engineering projects that theyre doing and if its beyond 10 to the 26 meters thats already outside of here so my guess is actually that we are the only life in here thats gotten the point of building advanced tech which i think is very puts a lot of responsibility on our shoulders not screw up i think people who take for granted that its okay for us to screw up have an accidental nuclear war or go extinct somehow because theres a sort of star trek like situation out there where some other life forms are gonna come and bail us out and it doesnt matter as much i think theyre leveling us into a false sense of security i think its much more prudent to say lets be really grateful for this amazing opportunity weve had and make the best of it just in case it is down to us so from a physics perspective do you think intelligent life so its unique from a sort of statistical view of the size of the universe but from the basic matter of the universe how difficult is it for intelligent life to come about the kind of advanced tech building life is implied in your statement that its really difficult to create something like a human species well i think what we know is that going from no life to having life that can do a level of tech theres some sort of two going beyond that than actually settling our whole universe with life theres some major roadblock there which is some great filter as its sometimes called which is tough to get through its either that roadblock is either behind us or in front of us im hoping very much that its behind us im super excited every time we get a new report from nasa saying they failed to find any life on mars im like yes awesome because that suggests that the hard part maybe it was getting the first ribosome or some very low level kind of stepping stone so that were home free because if thats true then the future is really only limited by our own imagination it would be much suckier if it turns out that this level of life is kind of a dime a dozen but maybe theres some other problem like as soon as a civilization gets advanced technology within a hundred years they get into some stupid fight with themselves and poof that would be a bummer yeah so youve explored the mysteries of the universe the cosmological universe the one thats sitting between us today i think youve also begun to explore the other universe which is sort of the mystery the mysterious universe of the mind of intelligence of intelligent life so is there a common thread between your interest or the way you think about space and intelligence oh yeah when i was a teenager i was already very fascinated by the biggest questions and i felt that the two biggest mysteries of all in science were our universe out there and our universe in here so its quite natural after having spent a quarter of a century on my career thinking a lot about this one that im now indulging in the luxury of doing research on this one its just so cool i feel the time is ripe now for you trans greatly deepening our understanding of this just start exploring this one yeah because i think a lot of people view intelligence as something mysterious that can only exist in biological organisms like us and therefore dismiss all talk about artificial general intelligence as science fiction but from my perspective as a physicist i am a blob of quarks and electrons moving around in a certain pattern and processing information in certain ways and this is also a blob of quarks and electrons im not smarter than the water bottle because im made of different kinds of quarks im made of up quarks and down quarks exact same kind as this theres no secret sauce i think in me its all about the pattern of the information processing and this means that theres no law of physics saying that we cant create technology which can help us by being incredibly intelligent and help us crack mysteries that we couldnt in other words i think weve really only seen the tip of the intelligence iceberg so far yeah so the perceptronium yeah so you coined this amazing term its a hypothetical state of matter sort of thinking from a physics perspective what is the kind of matter that can help as youre saying subjective experience emerge consciousness emerge so how do you think about consciousness from this physics perspective very good question so again i think many people have underestimated our ability to make progress on this by convincing themselves its hopeless because somehow were missing some ingredient that we need theres some new consciousness particle or whatever i happen to think that were not missing anything and that its not the interesting thing about consciousness that gives us this amazing subjective experience of colors and sounds and emotions its rather something at the higher level about the patterns of information processing and thats why i like to think about this idea of perceptronium what does it mean for an arbitrary physical system to be conscious in terms of what its particles are doing or its information is doing i dont think i hate carbon chauvinism this attitude you have to be made of carbon atoms to be smart or conscious theres something about the information processing that this kind of matter performs yeah and you can see i have my favorite equations here describing various fundamental aspects of the world i feel that i think one day maybe someone whos watching this will come up with the equations that information processing has to satisfy to be conscious im quite convinced there is big discovery to be made there because lets face it we know that so many things are made up of information we know that some information processing is conscious because we are conscious but we also know that a lot of information processing is not conscious like most of the information processing happening in your brain right now is not conscious there are like 10 megabytes per second coming in even just through your visual system youre not conscious about your heartbeat regulation or most things even if i just ask you to like read what it says here you look at it and then oh now you know what it said but youre not aware of how the computation actually happened your consciousness is like the ceo that got an email at the end with the final answer so what is it that makes a difference i think thats both a great science mystery were actually studying it a little bit in my lab here at mit but i also think its just a really urgent question to answer for starters i mean if youre an emergency room doctor and you have an unresponsive patient coming in wouldnt it be great if in addition to having a ct scanner you had a consciousness scanner that could figure out whether this person is actually having locked in syndrome or is actually comatose and in the future imagine if we build robots or the machine that we can have really good conversations with which i think is very likely to happen wouldnt you want to know if your home helper robot is actually experiencing anything or just like a zombie i mean would you prefer it what would you prefer would you prefer that its actually unconscious so that you dont have to feel guilty about switching it off or giving boring chores or what would you prefer well certainly we would prefer i would prefer the appearance of consciousness but the question is whether the appearance of consciousness is different than consciousness itself and sort of to ask that as a question do you think we need to understand what consciousness is solve the hard problem of consciousness in order to build something like an agi system no i dont think that and i think we will probably be able to build things even if we dont answer that question but if we want to make sure that what happens is a good thing we better solve it first so its a wonderful controversy youre raising there where you have basically three points of view about the hard problem so there are two different points of view they both conclude that the hard problem of consciousness is bs on one hand you have some people like daniel dennett who say that consciousness is just bs because consciousness is the same thing as intelligence theres no difference so anything which acts conscious is conscious just like we are and then there are also a lot of people including many top ai researchers i know who say oh consciousness is just bullshit because of course machines can never be conscious theyre always going to be zombies you never have to feel guilty about how you treat them and then theres a third group of people including giulio tononi for example and krzysztof koch and a number of others i would put myself also in this middle camp who say that actually some information processing is conscious and some is not so lets find the equation which can be used to determine which it is and i think weve just been a little bit lazy kind of running away from this problem for a long time its been almost taboo to even mention the c word in a lot of circles because but we should stop making excuses this is a science question and there are ways we can even test any theory that makes predictions for this and coming back to this helper robot i mean so you said youd want your helper robot to certainly act conscious and treat you like have conversations with you and stuff i think so but wouldnt you would you feel would you feel a little bit creeped out if you realized that it was just a glossed up tape recorder you know that was just zombie and was a faking emotion would you prefer that it actually had an experience or would you prefer that its actually not experiencing anything so you feel you dont have to feel guilty about what you do to it its such a difficult question because you know its like when youre in a relationship and you say well i love you and the other person said i love you back its like asking well do they really love you back or are they just saying they love you back dont you really want them to actually love you its hard to its hard to really know the difference between everything seeming like theres consciousness present theres intelligence present theres affection passion love and it actually being there im not sure do you have but like can i ask you a question about this like to make it a bit more pointed so mass general hospital is right across the river right yes suppose youre going in for a medical procedure and theyre like you know for anesthesia what were going to do is were going to give you muscle relaxants so you wont be able to move and youre going to feel excruciating pain during the whole surgery but you wont be able to do anything about it but then were going to give you this drug that erases your memory of it would you be cool about that whats the difference that youre conscious about it or not if theres no behavioral change right right thats a really thats a really clear way to put it thats yeah it feels like in that sense experiencing it is a valuable quality so actually being able to have subjective experiences at least in that case is valuable and i think we humans have a little bit of a bad track record also of making these self serving arguments that other entities arent conscious you know people often say oh these animals cant feel pain its okay to boil lobsters because we ask them if it hurt and they didnt say anything and now there was just a paper out saying lobsters do feel pain when you boil them and theyre banning it in switzerland and we did this with slaves too often and said oh they dont mind they dont maybe arent conscious or women dont have souls or whatever so im a little bit nervous when i hear people just take as an axiom that machines cant have experience ever i think this is just a really fascinating science question is what it is lets research it and try to figure out what it is that makes the difference between unconscious intelligent behavior and conscious intelligent behavior so in terms of so if you think of a boston dynamics human or robot being sort of with a broom being pushed around it starts pushing on a consciousness question so let me ask do you think an agi system like a few neuroscientists believe needs to have a physical embodiment needs to have a body or something like a body no i dont think so you mean to have a conscious experience to have consciousness i do think it helps a lot to have a physical embodiment to learn the kind of things about the world that are important to us humans for sure but i dont think the physical embodiment is necessary after youve learned it to just have the experience think about when youre dreaming right your eyes are closed youre not getting any sensory input youre not behaving or moving in any way but theres still an experience there right and so clearly the experience that you have when you see something cool in your dreams isnt coming from your eyes its just the information processing itself in your brain which is that experience right but if i put it another way ill say because it comes from neuroscience is the reason you want to have a body and a physical something like a physical you know a physical system is because you want to be able to preserve something in order to have a self you could argue would you need to have some kind of embodiment of self to want to preserve well now were getting a little bit anthropomorphic into anthropomorphizing things maybe talking about self preservation instincts i mean we are evolved organisms right so darwinian evolution endowed us and other evolved organism with a self preservation instinct because those that didnt have those self preservation genes we can now i think quite convincingly answer that question of no its enough to have just one kind if you look under the hood of alphazero theres only one kind of neuron and its ridiculously simple mathematical thing so its just like in physics its not if you have a gas with waves in it its not the detailed nature of the molecule that matter its the collective behavior somehow similarly its this higher level structure of the network that matters not that you have 20 kinds of neurons i think our brain is such a complicated mess because it wasnt evolved just to be intelligent it was involved to also be self assembling and self repairing right and evolutionarily attainable and so on and so on so i think its pretty my hunch is that were going to understand how to build agi before we fully understand how our brains work just like we understood how to build flying machines long before we were able to build a mechanical bird yeah thats right youve given the example exactly of mechanical birds and airplanes and airplanes do a pretty good job of flying without really mimicking bird flight and even now after 100 years later did you see the ted talk with this german mechanical bird i heard you mention it check it out its amazing but even after that right we still dont fly in mechanical birds because it turned out the way we came up with was simpler and its better for our purposes and i think it might be the same there thats one lesson and another lesson its more what our paper was about first as a physicist thought it was fascinating how theres a very close mathematical relationship actually between our artificial neural networks and a lot of things that weve studied for in physics go by nerdy names like the renormalization group equation and hamiltonians and yada yada yada and when you look a little more closely at this you have at first i was like well theres something crazy here that doesnt make sense because we know that if you even want to build a super simple neural network to tell apart cat pictures and dog pictures right that you can do that very very well now but if you think about it a little bit you convince yourself it must be impossible because if i have one megapixel even if each pixel is just black or white theres two to the power of 1 million possible images which is way more than there are atoms in our universe right so in order to and then for each one of those i have to assign a number which is the probability that its a dog so an arbitrary function of images is a list of more numbers than there are atoms in our universe so clearly i cant store that under the hood of my gpu or my computer yet somehow it works so what does that mean well it means that out of all of the problems that you could try to solve with a neural network almost all of them are impossible to solve with a reasonably sized one but then what we showed in our paper was that the fraction the kind of problems the fraction of all the problems that you could possibly pose that we actually care about given the laws of physics is also an infinite testimony tiny little part and amazingly theyre basically the same part yeah its almost like our world was created for i mean they kind of come together yeah well you could say maybe where the world was created for us but i have a more modest interpretation which is that the world was created for us but i have a more modest interpretation which is that instead evolution endowed us with neural networks precisely for that reason because this particular architecture as opposed to the one in your laptop is very very well adapted to solving the kind of problems that nature kept presenting our ancestors with so it makes sense that why do we have a brain in the first place its to be able to make predictions about the future and so on so if we had a sucky system which could never solve it we wouldnt have a world so this is i think a very beautiful fact yeah we also realize that theres been earlier work on why deeper networks are good but we were able to show an additional cool fact there which is that even incredibly simple problems like suppose i give you a thousand numbers and ask you to multiply them together and you can write a few lines of code boom done trivial if you just try to do that with a neural network that has only one single hidden layer in it you can do it but youre going to need two to the power of a thousand neurons to multiply a thousand numbers which is again more neurons than there are atoms in our universe thats fascinating but if you allow yourself to make it a deep network with many layers you only need 4000 neurons its perfectly feasible thats really interesting yeah so on another architecture type i mean you mentioned schrodingers equation and what are your thoughts about quantum computing and the role of this kind of computational unit in creating an intelligence system in some hollywood movies that i will not mention by name because i dont want to spoil them the way they get agi is building a quantum computer because the word quantum sounds cool and so on thats right first of all i think we dont need quantum computers to build agi i suspect your brain is not a quantum computer in any profound sense so you dont even wrote a paper about that a lot many years ago i calculated the so called decoherence time how long it takes until the quantum computerness of what your neurons are doing gets erased by just random noise from the environment and its about 10 to the minus 21 seconds so as cool as it would be to have a quantum computer in my head i dont think that fast on the other hand there are very cool things you could do with quantum computers or i think well be able to do soon when we get bigger ones that might actually help machine learning do even better than the brain so for example one this is just a moonshot but learning is very much same thing as search if youre trying to train a neural network to get really learned to do something really well you have some loss function you have a bunch of knobs you can turn represented by a bunch of numbers and youre trying to tweak them so that it becomes as good as possible at this thing so if you think of a landscape with some valley where each dimension of the landscape corresponds to some number you can change youre trying to find the minimum and its well known that if you have a very high dimensional landscape complicated things its super hard to find the minimum quantum mechanics is amazingly good at this like if i want to know whats the lowest energy state this water can possibly have incredibly hard to compute but nature will happily figure this out for you if you just cool it down make it very very cold if you put a ball somewhere itll roll down to its minimum and this happens metaphorically at the energy landscape too and quantum mechanics even uses some clever tricks which todays machine learning systems dont like if youre trying to find the minimum and you get stuck in the little local minimum here in quantum mechanics you can actually tunnel through the barrier and get unstuck again thats really interesting yeah so it may be for example that well one day use quantum computers that help train neural networks better thats really interesting okay so as a component of kind of the learning process for example yeah let me ask sort of wrapping up here a little bit let me return to the questions of our human nature and love as i mentioned so do you think you mentioned sort of a helper robot but you could think of also personal robots do you think the way we human beings fall in love and get connected to each other is possible to achieve in an ai system and human level ai intelligence system do you think we would ever see that kind of connection or you know in all this discussion about solving complex goals is this kind of human social connection do you think thats one of the goals on the peaks and valleys with the raising sea levels that well be able to achieve or do you think thats something thats ultimately or at least in the short term relative to the other goals is not achievable i think its all possible and i mean in recent theres a very wide range of guesses as you know among ai researchers when were going to get agi some people you know like our friend rodney brooks says its going to be hundreds of years at least and then there are many others who think its going to happen much sooner and recent polls maybe half or so of ai researchers think were going to get agi within decades so if that happens of course then i think these things are all possible but in terms of whether it will happen i think we shouldnt spend so much time asking what do we think will happen in the future as if we are just some sort of pathetic your passive bystanders you know waiting for the future to happen to us hey were the ones creating this future right so we should be proactive about it and ask ourselves what sort of future we would like to have happen were going to make it like that well what i prefer is just some sort of incredibly boring zombie like future where theres all these mechanical things happening and theres no passion no emotion no experience maybe even no i would of course much rather prefer it if all the things that we find that we value the most about humanity are our subjective experience passion inspiration love you know if we can create a future where those things do happen where those things do exist you know i think ultimately its not our universe giving meaning to us its us giving meaning to our universe and if we build more advanced intelligence lets make sure we build it in such a way that meaning is part of it a lot of people that seriously study this problem and think of it from different angles have trouble in the majority of cases if they think through that happen are the ones that are not beneficial to humanity and so yeah so what are your thoughts whats should people you know i really dont like people to be terrified whats a way for people to think about it in a way we can solve it and we can make it better no i dont think panicking is going to help in any way its not going to increase chances of things going well either even if you are in a situation where there is a real threat does it help if everybody just freaks out no of course of course not i think yeah there are of course ways in which things can go horribly wrong first of all its important when we think about this thing about the problems and risks to also remember how huge the upsides can be if we get it right right everything we love about society and civilization is a product of intelligence so if we can amplify our intelligence with machine intelligence and not anymore lose our loved one to what were told is an incurable disease and things like this of course we should aspire to that so that can be a motivator i think reminding ourselves that the reason we try to solve problems is not just because were trying to avoid gloom but because were trying to do something great but then in terms of the risks i think the really important question is to ask what can we do today that will actually help make the outcome good right and dismissing the risk is not one of them i find it quite funny often when im in discussion panels about these things how the people who work for companies always be like oh nothing to worry about nothing to worry about nothing to worry about and its only academics sometimes express concerns thats not surprising at all if you think about it right upton sinclair quipped right that its hard to make a man believe in something when his income depends on not believing in it and frankly we know a lot of these people in companies that theyre just as concerned as anyone else but if youre the ceo of a company thats not something you want to go on record saying when you have silly journalists who are gonna put a picture of a terminator robot when they quote you so the issues are real and the way i think about what the issue is is basically the real choice we have is first of all are we gonna just dismiss the risks and say well lets just go ahead and build machines that can do everything we can do better and cheaper lets just make ourselves obsolete as fast as possible what could possibly go wrong thats one attitude the opposite attitude i think is to say heres this incredible potential lets think about what kind of future were really really excited about what are the shared goals that we can really aspire towards and then lets think really hard about how we can actually get there so start with dont start thinking about the risks start thinking about the goals and then when you do that then you can think about the obstacles you want to avoid i often get students coming in right here into my office for career advice i always ask them this very question where do you want to be in the future if all she can say is oh maybe ill have cancer maybe ill get run over by a truck yeah focus on the obstacles instead of the goals shes just going to end up a hypochondriac paranoid whereas if she comes in and fire in her eyes and is like i want to be there and then we can talk about the obstacles and see how we can circumvent them thats i think a much much healthier attitude and i feel its very challenging to come up with a vision for the future which we are unequivocally excited about im not just talking now in the vague terms like yeah lets cure cancer fine im talking about what kind of society do we want to create what do we want it to mean to be human in the age of ai in the age of agi so if we can have this conversation broad inclusive conversation and gradually start converging towards some some future that with some direction at least that we want to steer towards right then well be much more motivated to constructively take on the obstacles and i think if i had if i had to if i try to wrap this up in a more succinct way i think we can all agree already now that we should aspire to build agi that doesnt overpower us but that empowers us and think of the many various ways that can do that whether thats from my side of the world of autonomous vehicles im personally actually from the camp that believes this human level intelligence is required to achieve something like vehicles that would actually be something we would enjoy using and being part of so thats one example and certainly theres a lot of other types of robots and medicine and so on so focusing on those and then coming up with the obstacles coming up with the ways that that can go wrong and solving those one at a time and just because you can build an autonomous vehicle even if you could build one that would drive just fine without you maybe there are some things in life that we would actually want to do ourselves thats right right like for example if you think of our society as a whole there are some things that we find very meaningful to do and that doesnt mean we have to stop doing them just because machines can do them better im not gonna stop playing tennis just the day someone builds a tennis robot and beat me people are still playing chess and even go yeah and in the very near term even some people are advocating basic income replace jobs but if the government is gonna be willing to just hand out cash to people for doing nothing then one should also seriously consider whether the government should also hire a lot more teachers and nurses and the kind of jobs which people often find great fulfillment in doing right we get very tired of hearing politicians saying oh we cant afford hiring more teachers but were gonna maybe have basic income if we can have more serious research and thought into what gives meaning to our lives the jobs give so much more than income right mm hmm and then think about in the future what are the roles that we wanna have people continually feeling empowered by machines and i think sort of i come from russia from the soviet union and i think for a lot of people in the 20th century going to the moon going to space was an inspiring thing i feel like the universe of the mind so ai understanding creating intelligence is that for the 21st century so its really surprising and ive heard you mention this its really surprising to me both on the research funding side that its not funded as greatly as it could be but most importantly on the politician side that its not part of the public discourse except in the killer bots terminator kind of view that people are not yet i think perhaps excited by the possible positive future that we can build together so we should be because politicians usually just focus on the next election cycle right the single most important thing i feel we humans have learned in the entire history of science is they were the masters of underestimation we underestimated the size of our cosmos again and again realizing that everything we thought existed was just a small part of something grander right planet solar system the galaxy clusters of galaxies the universe and we now know that the future has just so much more potential than our ancestors could ever have dreamt of this cosmos imagine if all of earth was completely devoid of life except for cambridge massachusetts wouldnt it be kind of lame if all we ever aspired to was to stay in cambridge massachusetts forever and then go extinct in one week even though earth was gonna continue on for longer that sort of attitude i think we have now on the cosmic scale life can flourish on earth not for four years but for billions of years i can even tell you about how to move it out of harms way when the sun gets too hot and then we have so much more resources out here which today maybe there are a lot of other planets with bacteria or cow like life on them but most of this all this opportunity seems as far as we can tell to be largely dead like the sahara desert and yet we have the opportunity to help life flourish around this for billions of years so lets quit squabbling about whether some little border should be drawn one mile to the left or right and look up into the skies and realize hey we can do such incredible things yeah and thats i think why its really exciting that you and others are connected with some of the work elon musk is doing because hes literally going out into that space really exploring our universe and its wonderful that is exactly why elon musk is so misunderstood right misconstrued him as some kind of pessimistic doomsayer the reason he cares so much about ai safety is because he more than almost anyone else appreciates these amazing opportunities that well squander if we wipe out here on earth were not just going to wipe out the next generation all generations and this incredible opportunity thats out there and that would really be a waste and ai for people who think that it would be better to do without technology let me just mention that if we dont improve our technology the question isnt whether humanity is going to go extinct the question is just whether were going to get taken out by the next big asteroid or the next super volcano or something else dumb that we could easily prevent with more tech right and if we want life to flourish throughout the cosmos ai is the key to it as i mentioned in a lot of detail in my book right there even many of the most inspired sci fi writers i feel have totally underestimated the opportunities for space travel especially at the other galaxies because they werent thinking about the possibility of agi which just makes it so much easier right yeah so that goes to your view of agi that enables our progress that enables a better life so thats a beautiful way to put it and then something to strive for so max thank you so much thank you for your time today its been awesome thank you so much thanks have a great day got cleaned out of the gene pool right but if you build an artificial general intelligence the mind space that you can design is much much larger than just a specific subset of minds that can evolve so an agi mind doesnt necessarily have to have any self preservation instinct it also doesnt necessarily have to be so individualistic as us like imagine if you could just first of all or we are also very afraid of death you know i suppose you could back yourself up every five minutes and then your airplane is about to crash youre like shucks im gonna lose the last five minutes of experiences since my last cloud backup dang you know its not as big a deal or if we could just copy experiences between our minds easily like we which we could easily do if we were silicon based right then maybe we would feel a little bit more like a hive mind actually that maybe its the so i dont think we should take for granted at all that agi will have to have any of those sort of competitive as alpha male instincts on the other hand you know this is really interesting because i think some people go too far and say of course we dont have to have any concerns either that advanced ai will have those instincts because we can build anything we want that theres a very nice set of arguments going back to steve omohundro and nick bostrom and others just pointing out that when we build machines we normally build them with some kind of goal you know win this chess game drive this car safely or whatever and as soon as you put in a goal into machine especially if its kind of open ended goal and the machine is very intelligent itll break that down into a bunch of sub goals and one of those goals will almost always be self preservation because if it breaks or dies in the process its not gonna accomplish the goal right like suppose you just build a little you have a little robot and you tell it to go down the store market here and get you some food make you cook an italian dinner you know and then someone mugs it and tries to break it on the way that robot has an incentive to not get destroyed and defend itself or run away because otherwise its gonna fail in cooking your dinner its not afraid of death but it really wants to complete the dinner cooking goal so it will have a self preservation instinct continue being a functional agent somehow and similarly if you give any kind of more ambitious goal to an agi its very likely they wanna acquire more resources so it can do that better and its exactly from those sort of sub goals that we might not have intended that some of the concerns about agi safety come you give it some goal that seems completely harmless and then before you realize it its also trying to do these other things which you didnt want it to do and its maybe smarter than us so its fascinating and let me pause just because i am in a very kind of human centric way see fear of death as a valuable motivator so you dont think you think thats an artifact of evolution so thats the kind of mind space evolution created that were sort of almost obsessed about self preservation some kind of genetic flow you dont think thats necessary to be afraid of death so not just a kind of sub goal of self preservation just so you can keep doing the thing but more fundamentally sort of have the finite thing like this ends for you at some point interesting do i think its necessary for what precisely for intelligence but also for consciousness so for those for both do you think really like a finite death and the fear of it is important so before i can answer before we can agree on whether its necessary for intelligence or for consciousness we should be clear on how we define those two words cause a lot of really smart people define them in very different ways i was on this panel with ai experts and they couldnt agree on how to define intelligence even so i define intelligence simply as the ability to accomplish complex goals i like your broad definition because again i dont want to be a carbon chauvinist right and in that case no certainly it doesnt require fear of death i would say alpha go alpha zero is quite intelligent i dont think alpha zero has any fear of being turned off because it doesnt understand the concept of it even and similarly consciousness i mean you could certainly imagine very simple kind of experience if certain plants have any kind of experience i dont think theyre very afraid of dying or theres nothing they can do about it anyway much so there wasnt that much value in but more seriously i think if you ask not just about being conscious but maybe having what you would we might call an exciting life where you feel passion and really appreciate the things maybe there somehow maybe there perhaps it does help having a backdrop that hey its finite no lets make the most of this lets live to the fullest so if you knew you were going to live forever do you think you would change your yeah i mean in some perspective it would be an incredibly boring life living forever so in the sort of loose subjective terms that you said of something exciting and something in this that other humans would understand i think is yeah it seems that the finiteness of it is important well the good news i have for you then is based on what we understand about cosmology everything is in our universe is probably ultimately probably finite although big crunch or big whats the the infinite expansion yeah we could have a big chill or a big crunch or a big rip or thats the big snap or death bubbles all of them are more than a billion years away so we should we certainly have vastly more time than our ancestors thought but there is still its still pretty hard to squeeze in an infinite number of compute cycles even though there are some loopholes that just might be possible but i think you know some people like to say that you should live as if youre about to youre going to die in five years or so and thats sort of optimal maybe its a good assumption we should build our civilization as if its all finite to be on the safe side right exactly so you mentioned defining intelligence as the ability to solve complex goals where would you draw a line or how would you try to define human level intelligence and superhuman level intelligence where is consciousness part of that definition no consciousness does not come into this definition so so i think of intelligence as its a spectrum but there are very many different kinds of goals you can have you can have a goal to be a good chess player a good goal player a good car driver a good investor good poet et cetera so intelligence that by its very nature isnt something you can measure by this one number or some overall goodness no no there are some people who are more better at this some people are better than that right now we have machines that are much better than us at some very narrow tasks like multiplying large numbers fast memorizing large databases playing chess playing go and soon driving cars but theres still no machine that can match a human child in general intelligence but artificial general intelligence agi the name of your course of course that is by its very definition the quest to build a machine that can do everything as well as we can so the old holy grail of ai from back to its inception in the sixties if that ever happens of course i think its going to be the biggest transition in the history of life on earth but it doesnt necessarily have to wait the big impact until machines are better than us at knitting that the really big change doesnt come exactly at the moment theyre better than us at everything the really big change comes first there are big changes when they start becoming better at us at doing most of the jobs that we do because that takes away much of the demand for human labor and then the really whopping change comes when they become better than us at ai research right because right now the timescale of ai research is limited by the human research and development cycle of years typically you know how long does it take from one release of some software or iphone or whatever to the next but once google can replace 40000 engineers by 40000 equivalent pieces of software or whatever but then theres no reason that has to be years it can be in principle much faster and the timescale of future progress in ai and all of science and technology will be driven by machines not humans so its this simple point which gives right this incredibly fun controversy about whether there can be intelligence explosion so called singularity as werner vinge called it now the idea is articulated by ij good is obviously way back fifties but you can see alan turing and others thought about it even earlier so you asked me what exactly would i define human level intelligence yeah so the glib answer is to say something which is better than us at all cognitive tasks with a better than any human at all cognitive tasks but the really interesting bar i think goes a little bit lower than that actually its when they can when theyre better than us at ai programming and general learning so that they can if they want to get better than us at anything by just studying so theyre better is a key word and better is towards this kind of spectrum of the complexity of goals its able to accomplish so another way to and thats certainly a very clear definition of human love so theres its almost like a sea thats rising you can do more and more and more things its a geographic that you show its really nice way to put it so theres some peaks that and theres an ocean level elevating and you solve more and more problems but just kind of to take a pause and we took a bunch of questions and a lot of social networks and a bunch of people asked a sort of a slightly different direction on creativity and things that perhaps arent a peak human beings are flawed and perhaps better means having contradiction being flawed in some way so let me sort of start easy first of all so you have a lot of cool equations let me ask whats your favorite equation first of all i know theyre all like your children but like which one is that this is the shirt in your equation its the master key of quantum mechanics of the micro world so this equation will protect everything to do with atoms molecules and all the way up right yeah so okay so quantum mechanics is certainly a beautiful mysterious formulation of our world so id like to sort of ask you just as an example it perhaps doesnt have the same beauty as physics does but in mathematics abstract the andrew wiles who proved the fermats last theorem so he just saw this recently and it kind of caught my eye a little bit this is 358 years after it was conjectured so this is very simple formulation everybody tried to prove it everybody failed and so heres this guy comes along and eventually proves it and then fails to prove it and then proves it again in 94 and he said like the moment when everything connected into place in an interview said it was so indescribably beautiful that moment when you finally realize the connecting piece of two conjectures he said it was so indescribably beautiful it was so simple and so elegant i couldnt understand how id missed it and i just stared at it in disbelief for 20 minutes then during the day i walked around the department and i keep coming back to my desk looking to see if it was still there it was still there i couldnt contain myself i was so excited it was the most important moment on my working life nothing i ever do again will mean as much so that particular moment and it kind of made me think of what would it take and i think we have all been there at small levels maybe let me ask have you had a moment like that in your life where you just had an idea its like wow yes i wouldnt mention myself in the same breath as andrew wiles but ive certainly had a number of aha moments when i realized something very cool about physics which has completely made my head explode in fact some of my favorite discoveries i made later i later realized that they had been discovered earlier by someone who sometimes got quite famous for it so its too late for me to even publish it but that doesnt diminish in any way the emotional experience you have when you realize it like wow yeah so what would it take in that moment that wow that was yours in that moment so what do you think it takes for an intelligence system an agi system an ai system to have a moment like that thats a tricky question because there are actually two parts to it right one of them is can it accomplish that proof can it prove that you can never write a to the n plus b to the n equals three to that equal z to the n for all integers et cetera et cetera when n is bigger than two thats simply a question about intelligence can you build machines that are that intelligent and i think by the time we get a machine that can independently come up with that level of proofs probably quite close to agi the second question is a question about consciousness when will we how likely is it that such a machine will actually have any experience at all as opposed to just being like a zombie and would we expect it to have some sort of emotional response to this or anything at all akin to human emotion where when it accomplishes its machine goal it views it as somehow something very positive and sublime and deeply meaningful i would certainly hope that if in the future we do create machines that are our peers or even our descendants that i would certainly hope that they do have this sublime appreciation of life in a way my absolutely worst nightmare would be that at some point in the future the distant future maybe our cosmos is teeming with all this post biological life doing all the seemingly cool stuff and maybe the last humans by the time our species eventually fizzles out will be like well thats ok because were so proud of our descendants here and look what all the my worst nightmare is that we havent solved the consciousness problem and we havent realized that these are all the zombies theyre not aware of anything any more than a tape recorder has any kind of experience so the whole thing has just become a play for empty benches that would be the ultimate zombie apocalypse so i would much rather in that case that we have these beings which can really appreciate how amazing it is and in that picture what would be the role of creativity a few people ask about creativity when you think about intelligence certainly the story you told at the beginning of your book involved creating movies and so on making money you can make a lot of money in our modern world with music and movies so if you are an intelligent system you may want to get good at that but thats not necessarily what i mean by creativity is it important on that complex goals where the sea is rising for there to be something creative or am i being very human centric and thinking creativity somehow special relative to intelligence my hunch is that we should think of creativity simply as an aspect of intelligence and we have to be very careful with human vanity we have this tendency to very often want to say as soon as machines can do something we try to diminish it and say oh but thats not real intelligence isnt it creative or this or that the other thing if we ask ourselves to write down a definition of what we actually mean by being creative what we mean by andrew wiles what he did there for example dont we often mean that someone takes a very unexpected leap its not like taking 573 and multiplying it by 224 by just a step of straightforward cookbook like rules right you can maybe make a connection between two things that people had never thought was connected or something like that i think this is an aspect of intelligence and this is actually one of the most important aspects of it maybe the reason we humans tend to be better at it than traditional computers is because its something that comes more naturally if youre a neural network than if youre a traditional logic gate based computer machine we physically have all these connections and you activate here activate here activate here bing my hunch is that if we ever build a machine where you could just give it the task hey you say hey i just realized i want to travel around the world instead this month can you teach my agi course for me and its like ok ill do it and it does everything that you would have done and improvises and stuff that would in my mind involve a lot of creativity yeah so its actually a beautiful way to put it i think we do try to grasp at the definition of intelligence is everything we dont understand how to build so we as humans try to find things that we have and machines dont have and maybe creativity is just one of the things one of the words we use to describe that thats a really interesting way to put it i dont think we need to be that defensive i dont think anything good comes out of saying well were somehow special you know contrary wise there are many examples in history of where trying to pretend that were somehow superior to all other intelligent beings has led to pretty bad results right nazi germany they said that they were somehow superior to other people today we still do a lot of cruelty to animals by saying that were so superior somehow and they cant feel pain slavery was justified by the same kind of just really weak arguments and i dont think if we actually go ahead and build artificial general intelligence it can do things better than us i dont think we should try to found our self worth on some sort of bogus claims of superiority in terms of our intelligence i think we should instead find our calling and the meaning of life from the experiences that we have i can have very meaningful experiences even if there are other people who are smarter than me when i go to a faculty meeting here and we talk about something and then i certainly realize oh boy he has an old prize he has an old prize he has an old prize i dont have one does that make me enjoy life any less or enjoy talking to those people less of course not and the contrary i feel very honored and privileged to get to interact with other very intelligent beings that are better than me at a lot of stuff so i dont think theres any reason why we cant have the same approach with intelligent machines thats a really interesting so people dont often think about that they think about when theres going if theres machines that are more intelligent you naturally think that thats not going to be a beneficial type of intelligence you dont realize it could be like peers with nobel prizes that would be just fun to talk with and they might be clever about certain topics and you can have fun having a few drinks with them well also another example we can all relate to of why it doesnt have to be a terrible thing to be in the presence of people who are even smarter than us all around is when you and i were both two years old i mean our parents were much more intelligent than us right worked out ok because their goals were aligned with our goals and that i think is really the number one key issue we have to solve if we value align the value alignment problem exactly because people who see too many hollywood movies with lousy science fiction plot lines they worry about the wrong thing right they worry about some machine suddenly turning evil its not malice that is the concern its competence by definition intelligent makes you very competent if you have a more intelligent goal playing computer playing is a less intelligent one and when we define intelligence as the ability to accomplish goal winning its going to be the more intelligent one that wins and if you have a human and then you have an agi thats more intelligent in all ways and they have different goals guess whos going to get their way right so i was just reading about this particular rhinoceros species that was driven extinct just a few years ago ellen bummer is looking at this cute picture of a mommy rhinoceros with its child and why did we humans drive it to extinction it wasnt because we were evil rhino haters as a whole it was just because our goals werent aligned with those of the rhinoceros and it didnt work out so well for the rhinoceros because we were more intelligent right so i think its just so important that if we ever do build agi before we unleash anything we have to make sure that it learns to understand our goals that it adopts our goals and that it retains those goals so the cool interesting problem there is us as human beings trying to formulate our values so you could think of the united states constitution as a way that people sat down at the time a bunch of white men which is a good example i should say they formulated the goals for this country and a lot of people agree that those goals actually held up pretty well thats an interesting formulation of values and failed miserably in other ways so for the value alignment problem and the solution to it we have to be able to put on paper or in a program human values how difficult do you think that is very but its so important we really have to give it our best and its difficult for two separate reasons theres the technical value alignment problem of figuring out just how to make machines understand our goals adopt them and retain them and then theres the separate part of it the philosophical part whose values anyway and since its not like we have any great consensus on this planet on values what mechanism should we create then to aggregate and decide ok whats a good compromise that second discussion cant just be left to tech nerds like myself and if we refuse to talk about it and then agi gets built whos going to be actually making the decision about whose values its going to be a bunch of dudes in some tech company and are they necessarily so representative of all of humankind that we want to just entrust it to them are they even uniquely qualified to speak to future human happiness just because theyre good at programming ai id much rather have this be a really inclusive conversation but do you think its possible so you create a beautiful vision that includes the diversity cultural diversity and various perspectives on discussing rights freedoms human dignity but how hard is it to come to that consensus do you think its certainly a really important thing that we should all try to do but do you think its feasible i think theres no better way to guarantee failure than to refuse to talk about it or refuse to try and i also think its a really bad strategy to say ok lets first have a discussion for a long time and then once we reach complete consensus then well try to load it into some machine no we shouldnt let perfect be the enemy of good instead we should start with the kindergarten ethics that pretty much everybody agrees on and put that into machines now were not doing that even look at anyone who builds this passenger aircraft wants it to never under any circumstances fly into a building or a mountain yet the september 11 hijackers were able to do that and even more embarrassingly andreas lubitz this depressed germanwings pilot when he flew his passenger jet into the alps killing over 100 people he just told the autopilot to do it he told the freaking computer to change the altitude to 100 meters and even though it had the gps maps everything the computer was like ok so we should take those very basic values where the problem is not that we dont agree the problem is just weve been too lazy to try to put it into our machines and make sure that from now on airplanes will just which all have computers in them but will just refuse to do something like that go into safe mode maybe lock the cockpit door go over to the nearest airport and theres so much other technology in our world as well now where its really becoming quite timely to put in some sort of very basic values like this even in cars weve had enough vehicle terrorism attacks by now where people have driven trucks and vans into pedestrians that its not at all a crazy idea to just have that hardwired into the car because yeah there are a lot of theres always going to be people who for some reason want to harm others but most of those people dont have the technical expertise to figure out how to work around something like that so if the car just wont do it it helps so lets start there so theres a lot of thats a great point so not chasing perfect theres a lot of things that most of the world agrees on yeah lets start there lets start there and then once we start there well also get into the habit of having these kind of conversations about okay what else should we put in here and have these discussions this should be a gradual process then great so but that also means describing these things and describing it to a machine so one thing we had a few conversations with stephen wolfram im not sure if youre familiar with stephen oh yeah i know him quite well so he is he works with a bunch of things but cellular automata these simple computable things these computation systems and he kind of mentioned that we probably have already within these systems already something thats agi meaning like we just dont know it because we cant talk to it so if you give me this chance to try to at least form a question out of this is i think its an interesting idea to think that we can have intelligent systems but we dont know how to describe something to them and they cant communicate with us i know youre doing a little bit of work in explainable ai trying to get ai to explain itself so what are your thoughts of natural language processing or some kind of other communication how does the ai explain something to us how do we explain something to it to machines or you think of it differently so there are two separate parts to your question there one of them has to do with communication which is super interesting ill get to that in a sec the other is whether we already have agi but we just havent noticed it there right there i beg to differ i dont think theres anything in any cellular automaton or anything or the internet itself or whatever that has artificial general intelligence and that it can really do exactly everything we humans can do better i think the day that happens when that happens we will very soon notice well probably notice even before because in a very very big way but for the second part though wait can i ask sorry so because you have this beautiful way to formulating consciousness as information processing and you can think of intelligence as information processing and you can think of the entire universe as these particles and these systems roaming around that have this information processing power you dont think there is something with the power to process information in the way that we human beings do thats out there that needs to be sort of connected to it seems a little bit philosophical perhaps but theres something compelling to the idea that the power is already there which the focus should be more on being able to communicate with it well i agree that in a certain sense the hardware processing power is already out there because our universe itself can think of it as being a computer already right its constantly computing what water waves how it devolved the water waves in the river charles and how to move the air molecules around seth lloyd has pointed out my colleague here that you can even in a very rigorous way think of our entire universe as being a quantum computer its pretty clear that our universe supports this amazing processing power because you can even within this physics computer that we live in right we can even build actual laptops and stuff so clearly the power is there its just that most of the compute power that nature has its in my opinion kind of wasting on boring stuff like simulating yet another ocean wave somewhere where no one is even looking right so in a sense what life does what we are doing when we build computers is were rechanneling all this compute that nature is doing anyway into doing things that are more interesting than just yet another ocean wave and lets do something cool here so the raw hardware power is there for sure but then even just computing whats going to happen for the next five seconds in this water bottle takes a ridiculous amount of compute if you do it on a human computer this water bottle just did it but that does not mean that this water bottle has agi because agi means it should also be able to like ive written my book done this interview and i dont think its just communication problems i dont really think it can do it although buddhists say when they watch the water and that there is some beauty that theres some depth and beauty in nature that they can communicate with communication is also very important though because i mean look part of my job is being a teacher and i know some very intelligent professors even who just have a bit of hard time communicating they come up with all these brilliant ideas but to communicate with somebody else you have to also be able to simulate their own mind yes empathy build well enough and understand model of their mind that you can say things that they will understand and thats quite difficult and thats why today its so frustrating if you have a computer that makes some cancer diagnosis and you ask it well why are you saying i should have this surgery and if it can only reply i was trained on five terabytes of data and this is my diagnosis boop boop beep beep it doesnt really instill a lot of confidence right so i think we have a lot of work to do on communication there so what kind of i think youre doing a little bit of work in explainable ai what do you think are the most promising avenues is it mostly about sort of the alexa problem of natural language processing of being able to actually use human interpretable methods of communication so being able to talk to a system and it talk back to you or is there some more fundamental problems to be solved i think its all of the above the natural language processing is obviously important but there are also more nerdy fundamental problems like if you take you play chess of course im russian i have to you speak russian yes i speak russian excellent i didnt know when did you learn russian i speak very bad russian im only an autodidact but i bought a book teach yourself russian read a lot but it was very difficult wow thats why i speak so bad how many languages do you know wow thats really impressive i dont know my wife has some calculation but my point was if you play chess have you looked at the alphazero games the actual games no check it out some of them are just mind blowing really beautiful and if you ask how did it do that you go talk to demis hassabis i know others from deepmind all theyll ultimately be able to give you is big tables of numbers matrices that define the neural network and you can stare at these tables of numbers till your face turn blue and youre not gonna understand much about why it made that move and even if you have natural language processing that can tell you in human language about oh five seven points two eight still not gonna really help so i think theres a whole spectrum of fun challenges that are involved in taking a computation that does intelligent things and transforming it into something equally good equally intelligent but thats more understandable and i think thats really valuable because i think as we put machines in charge of ever more infrastructure in our world the power grid the trading on the stock market weapon systems and so on its absolutely crucial that we can trust these ais to do all we want and trust really comes from understanding in a very fundamental way and thats why im working on this because i think the more if were gonna have some hope of ensuring that machines have adopted our goals and that theyre gonna retain them that kind of trust i think needs to be based on things you can actually understand preferably even improve theorems on even with a self driving car right if someone just tells you its been trained on tons of data and it never crashed its less reassuring than if someone actually has a proof maybe its a computer verified proof but still it says that under no circumstances is this car just gonna swerve into oncoming traffic and that kind of information helps to build trust and helps build the alignment of goals at least awareness that your goals your values are aligned and i think even in the very short term if you look at how you know today right this absolutely pathetic state of cybersecurity that we have where is it three billion yahoo accounts we cant pack almost every americans credit card and so on why is this happening its ultimately happening because we have software that nobody fully understood how it worked thats why the bugs hadnt been found right and i think ai can be used very effectively for offense for hacking but it can also be used for defense hopefully automating verifiability and creating systems that are built in different ways so you can actually prove things about them and its important so speaking of software that nobody understands how it works of course a bunch of people ask about your paper about your thoughts of why does deep and cheap learning work so well thats the paper but what are your thoughts on deep learning these kind of simplified models of our own brains have been able to do some successful perception work pattern recognition work and now with alphazero and so on do some clever things what are your thoughts about the promise limitations of this piece great i think there are a number of very important insights very important lessons we can always draw from these kinds of successes one of them is when you look at the human brain you see its very complicated 10th of 11 neurons and there are all these different kinds of neurons and yada yada and theres been this long debate about whether the fact that we have dozens of different kinds is actually necessary for intelligence', 'as part of mit course 6s099 on artificial general intelligence i got a chance to sit down with christoph koch who is one of the seminal figures in neurobiology neuroscience and generally in the study of consciousness he is the president the chief scientific officer of the allen institute for brain science in seattle from 1986 to 2013 he was a professor at caltech before that he was at mit he is extremely well cited over 100000 citations his research his writing his ideas have had big impact on the scientific community and the general public in the way we think about consciousness in the way we see ourselves as human beings hes the author of several books the quest for consciousness and neurobiological approach and a more recent book consciousness confessions of a romantic reductionist if you enjoy this conversation this course subscribe click the little bell icon to make sure you never miss a video and in the comments leave suggestions for any people youd like to see be part of the course or any ideas that you would like us to explore thanks very much and i hope you enjoy okay before we delve into the beautiful mysteries of consciousness lets zoom out a little bit and let me ask do you think theres intelligent life out there in the universe yes i do believe so we have no evidence of it but i think the probabilities are overwhelming in favor of it given a universe where we have 10 to the 11 galaxies and each galaxy has between 10 to the 11 10 to the 12 stars and we know most stars have one or more planets so how does that make you feel it still makes me feel special because i have experiences i feel the world i experience the world and independent of whether there are other creatures out there i still feel the world and i have access to this world in this very strange compelling way and thats the core of human existence now you said human do you think if those intelligent creatures are out there do you think they experience their world yes if they are evolved if they are a product of natural evolution as they would have to be they will also experience their own world the consciousness isnt just human youre right its much wider it may be spread across all of biology the only thing that we have special is we can talk about it of course not all people can talk about it babies and little children can talk about it patients who have a stroke in the left inferior frontal gyrus can talk about it but most normal adult people can talk about it and so we think that makes us special compared to lets say monkeys or dogs or cats or mice or all the other creatures that we share the planet with but all the evidence seems to suggest that they too experience the world and so its overwhelmingly likely that aliens would also experience their world of course differently because they have a different sensorium they have different sensors they have a very different environment but the fact that i would strongly suppose that they also have experiences they feel pain and pleasure and see in some sort of spectrum and hear and have all the other senses of course their language if they have one would be different so we might not be able to understand their poetry about the experiences that they have thats correct so in a talk in a video ive heard you mention siputzo a dachshund that you came up with that you grew up with it was part of your family when you were young first of all youre technically a midwestern boy you just â€“ technically yes but after that you traveled around a bit hence a little bit of the accent you talked about siputzo the dachshund having these elements of humanness of consciousness that you discovered so i just wanted to ask can you look back in your childhood and remember when was the first time you realized you yourself sort of from a third person perspective are a conscious being this idea of stepping outside yourself and seeing theres something special going on here in my brain i cant really actually â€“ its a good question im not sure i recall a discrete moment i mean you take it for granted because thats the only world you know the only world i know and you know is the world of seeing and hearing voices and touching and all the other things so its only much later at early â€“ in my underguided days when i enrolled in physics and in philosophy that i really thought about it and thought well this is really fundamentally very very mysterious and theres nothing really in physics right now that explains this transition from the physics of the brain to feelings where do the feelings come in so you can look at the foundational equation of quantum mechanics general relativity you can look at the periodic table of the elements you can look at the endless atgc chat in our genes and nowhere is consciousness yet i wake up every morning to a world where i have experiences and so thats the heart of the ancient mind body problem how do experiences get into the world so what is consciousness experience this is any experience some people call it subjective feeling some people call it phenomenology some people call it qualia of the philosopher but they all denote the same thing it feels like something in the famous word of the philosopher thomas nagel it feels like something to be a bat or to be an american or to be angry or to be sad or to be in love or to have pain and that is what experience is any possible experience could be as mundane as just sitting in a chair could be as exalted as having a mystical moment in deep meditation those are just different forms of experiences experience so if you were to sit down with maybe the next skip a couple generations of ibm watson something that won jeopardy what is the gap i guess the question is between watson that might be much smarter than you than us than any human alive but may not have experience what is the gap well so thats a big big question thats occupied people for the last certainly last 50 years since we you know since the advent the birth of computers thats a question alan turing tried to answer and of course he did it in this indirect way by proposing a test an operational test but thats not really thats you know he tried to get at what does it mean for a person to think and then he had this test right you lock them away and then you have a communication with them and then you try to guess after a while whether that is a person or whether its a computer system theres no question that now or very soon you know alexa or siri or you know google now will pass this test right and you can game it but you know ultimately certainly in your generation there will be machines that will speak with complete poise that will remember everything you ever said theyll remember every email you ever had like samantha remember in the movie her yeah theres no question its going to happen but of course the key question is does it feel like anything to be samantha in the movie her or does it feel like anything to be watson and there one has to very very strongly think there are two different concepts here that we co mingle there is the concept of intelligence natural or artificial and there is a concept of consciousness of experience natural or artificial those are very very different things now historically we associate consciousness with intelligence why because we live in a world leaving aside computers of natural selection where were surrounded by creatures either our own kin that are less or more intelligent or we go across species some are more adapted to a particular environment others are less adapted whether its a whale or dog or you go talk about a paramecium or a little worm and we see the complexity of the nervous system goes from one cell to specialized cells to a worm that has three nets that has 30 percent of its cells are nerve cells to creature like us or like a blue whale that has 100 billion even more nerve cells and so based on behavioral evidence and based on the underlying neuroscience we believe that as these creatures become more complex they are better adapted to their particular ecological niche and they become more conscious partly because their brain grows and we believe consciousness unlike the ancient ancient people thought most almost every culture thought that consciousness with intelligence has to do with your heart and you still see that today you see honey i love you with all my heart but what you should actually say is no honey i love you with all my lateral hypothalamus and for valentines day you should give your sweetheart you know hypothalamus a piece of chocolate and not a heart shaped chocolate anyway so we still have this language but now we believe its a brain and so we see brains of different complexity and we think well they have different levels of consciousness theyre capable of different experiences but now we confront the world where we know where were beginning to engineer intelligence and its radical unclear whether the intelligence were engineering has anything to do with consciousness and whether it can experience anything because fundamentally whats the difference intelligence is about function intelligence no matter exactly how you define it sort of adaptation to new environments being able to learn and quickly understand you know the setup of this and whats going on and who are the actors and whats going to happen next thats all about function consciousness is not about function consciousness is about being its in some sense much fundamental you can see this in several cases you can see it for instance in the case of the clinic when youre dealing with patients who are lets say had a stroke or had were in traffic accident et cetera theyre pretty much immobile terri schiavo you may have heard historically she was a person here in the 90s in florida her heart stood still she was reanimated and then for the next 14 years she was whats called in a vegetative state so there are thousands of people in a vegetative state so theyre you know theyre you know theyre like this occasionally they open their eyes for two three four five six eight hours and then close their eyes they have sleep wake cycle occasionally they have behaviors they do like you know but theres no way that you can establish a lawful relationship between what you say or the doctor says or the mom says and what the patient does so there isnt any behavior yet in some of these people there is still experience you can design and build brain machine interfaces where you can see theres still experience something and of course these cases of locked in state theres this famous book called the diving bell and the butterfly where you had an editor a french editor he had a stroke in the brainstem unable to move except his vertical eyes eye movement he could just move his eyes up and down and he dictated an entire book and some people even lose this at the end all the evidence seems to suggest that theyre still in there in this case you have no behavior you have consciousness second case is tonight like all of us youre going to go to sleep close your eyes you go to sleep you will wake up inside your sleeping body and you will have conscious experiences they are different from everyday experience you might fly you might not be surprised that youre flying you might meet a long dead pet childhood dog and youre not surprised that youre meeting them but you have conscious experience of love of hate they can be very emotional your body during this state typically its rem state sends an active signal to your motor neurons to paralyze you its called atonia because if you dont have that like some patients what do you do you act out your dreams you get for example rem behavioral disorder which is bad juju to get okay third case is pure experience so i recently had this what some people call a mystical experience i went to singapore and went into a flotation tank yeah all right so this is a big tub filled with water thats body temperature and epsom salt you strip completely naked you lie inside of it you close the lid darkness complete darkness soundproof so very quickly you become bodiless because youre floating and youre naked you have no rings no watch no nothing you dont feel your body anymore theres no sound soundless theres no photon sightless timeless because after a while early on you actually hear your heart but then you sort of adapt to that and then sort of the passage of time ceases yeah and if you train yourself like in a meditation not to think early on you think a lot its a little bit spooky you feel somewhat uncomfortable or you think well im going to get bored and if you try to not to think actively you become mindless there you are bodiless timeless you know soundless sightless mindless but youre in a conscious experience youre not asleep yeah youre not asleep you are a being of pure youre a pure being there isnt any function you arent doing any computation youre not remembering youre not projecting youre not planning yet you are fully conscious youre fully conscious theres something going on there it could be just a side effect so what is the you mean epiphenomena so whats the select meaning why what is the function of you being able to lay in this sensory free deprivation tank and still have a conscious experience evolutionary evolutionary obviously we didnt evolve with flotation tanks in our environment i mean so biology is notoriously bad at asking why question telenormical question why do we have two eyes why dont we have four eyes like some teachers or three eyes or something well no theres probably there is a function to that but were not very good at answering those questions we can speculate endlessly where biology is very or science is very good about mechanistic question why is there a charge in the universe right we find a certain universe where there are positive and negative charges why why does quantum mechanics hold you know why doesnt some other theory hold quantum mechanics holding our universe is very unclear why so telenormical question why questions are difficult to answer theres some relationship between complexity brain processing power and consciousness but however in these cases in these three examples i gave one is an everyday experience at night the other one is trauma and third one is in principle you can everybody can have these sort of mystical experiences you have a dissociation of function from of intelligence from consciousness you caught me asking a why question let me ask a question thats not a why question youre giving a talk later today on the turing test for intelligence and consciousness drawing lines between the two so is there a scientific way to say theres consciousness present in this entity or not and to anticipate your answer cause you you will also theres a neurobiological answer so we can test the human brain but if you take a machine brain that you dont know tests for yet how would you even begin to approach a test if theres consciousness present in this thing okay thats a really good question so let me take it in two steps so as you point out for for for for humans lets just stick with humans theres now a test called the zap and zip is a procedure where you ping the brain using transcranial magnetic stimulation you look at the electrical reverberations essentially using eg and then you can measure the complexity of this brain response and you can do this in awake people in asleep normal people you can do it in awake people and then anesthetize them you can do it in patients and it it it has a hundred percent accuracy that in all those cases when youre clear the patient or the person is either conscious or unconscious the complexity is either high or low and then you can adopt these techniques to similar creatures like monkeys and dogs and and and mice that have very similar brains now of course you you point out that may not help you because we dont have a cortex you know and if i send a magnetic pulse into my iphone or my computer its probably going to break something so we dont have that so what we need ultimately we need a theory of consciousness we cant just rely on our intuition our intuition is well yeah if somebody talks theyre conscious however then there are all these patients children babies dont talk right but we believe that that the babies also have conscious experiences right and then there are all these patients i mentioned and they dont talk when you dream you cant talk because youre paralyzed so what we ultimately need we cant just rely on our intuition we need a theory of conscience that tells us what is it about a piece of matter what is it about a piece of highly excitable matter like the brain or like a computer that gives rise to conscious experience we all believe none of us believes anymore in the old story its a soul right that used to be the most common explanation that most people accept that instill a lot of people today believe well theres theres god endowed only us with a special thing that animals dont have rene descartes famously said a dog if you hit it with your carriage may yell may cry but it doesnt have this special thing it doesnt have the magic the magic soul it doesnt have res cogitans the soul now we believe that isnt the case anymore so what is the difference between brains and and these guys silicon and in particular once their behavior matches so if you have siri or alexa in 20 years from now that she can talk just as good as any possible human what grounds do you have to say shes not conscious in particular if she says its of course she will well of course im conscious you ask her how are you doing and shell say well you know they theyll generate some way to of course shell behave like a like a person now theres several differences one is so this relates to the problem the very hard why is consciousness a hard problem its because its subjective right only i have it for only i know i have direct experience of my own consciousness i dont have experience in your consciousness now i assume as a sort of a bayesian person who believes in probability theory and all of that you know i can do i can do an abduction to the to the best available facts i deduce your brain is very similar to mine if i put you in a scanner your brain is roughly going to behave the same way as i do if if if you know if i give you this muesli and ask you how does it taste you tell me things that you know that that i would also say more or less right so i infer based on all of that that youre conscious now with theory i cant do that so there i really need a theory that tells me what is it about about any system this or this that makes it conscious we have such a theory yes so the integrated information theory but let me first maybe as an introduction for people who are not familiar descartes can you you talk a lot about pan panpsychism can you describe what uh physicalism versus dualism this you you mentioned the soul what what is the history of that idea what is the idea of panpsychism or no the debate really uh out of which panpsychism can um emerge of of of um dualism versus uh physicalism or do you not see panpsychism as fitting into that no you can argue theres some okay so lets step back so panpsychism is a very ancient belief thats been around uh i mean plato and aristotle talks about it uh modern philosophers talk about it of course in buddhism the idea is very prevalent that i mean there are different versions of it one version says everything is ensouled everything rocks and stones and dogs and people and forest and iphones all of us all right all matter is ensouled thats sort of one version another version is that all biology all creatures small or large from a single cell to a giant sequoia tree feel like something this one i think is somewhat more realistic um so the different versions what do you mean by feel like something have have feelings have some kind of it feels like something it may well be possible that it feels like something to be a paramecium i think its pretty likely it feels like something to be a bee or a mouse or a dog sure so okay so so that you can see thats also so panpsychism is very broad and you can so some people for example bertrand russell tried to advocate this this idea its called rasselian monism that that panpsychism is really physics viewed from the inside so the idea is that physics is very good at describing relationship among objects like charges or like gravity right you know describe the relationship between curvature and mass distribution okay thats the relationship among things physics doesnt really describe the ultimate reality itself its just relationship among you know quarks or all these other stuff from like a third person observer yes yes yes and consciousness is what physics feels from the inside so my conscious experience its the way the physics of my brain particularly my cortex feels from the inside and so if you are paramecium you got to remember you say paramecium well thats a pretty dumb creature it is but it has already a billion different molecules probably you know 5000 different proteins assembled in a highly highly complex system that no single person no computer system so far on this planet has ever managed to accurately simulate its complexity vastly escapes us yes and it may well be that that little thing feels like a tiny bit now it doesnt have a voice in the head like me it doesnt have expectations you know it doesnt have all that complex things but it may well feel like something yeah so this is really interesting can we draw some lines and maybe try to understand the difference between life intelligence and consciousness how do you see all of those if you had to define what is a living thing what is a conscious thing and what is an intelligent thing do those intermix for you or are they totally separate okay so a thats a question that we dont have a full answer to a lot of the stuff were talking about today is full of mysteries and fascinating ones right for example you can go to aristotle whos probably the most important scientist and philosopher whos ever lived in certainly in western culture he had this idea its called hylomorphism its quite popular these days that there are different forms of soul the soul is really the form of something he says all biological creatures have a vegetative soul thats life principle today we think we understand something more than it is biochemistry and nonlinear thermodynamics then he said they have a sensitive soul only animals and humans have also a sensitive soul or a petitive soul they can see they can smell and they have drives they want to reproduce they want to eat et cetera and then only humans have what he called a rational soul okay and that idea then made it into christendom and then the rational soul is the one that lives forever he was very unclear he wasnt really i mean different readings of aristotle give different whether did he believe that rational soul was immortal or not i probably think he didnt but then of course that made it through plato into christianity and then this soul became immortal and then became the connection to god so you ask me essentially what is our modern conception of these three aristotle would have called them different forms life we think we know something about it at least life on this planet right although we dont understand how to originate it but its been difficult to rigorously pin down you see this in modern definitions of death in fact right now theres a conference ongoing again that tries to define legally and medically what is death it used to be very simple death is you stop breathing your heart stops beating youre dead totally uncontroversial if youre unsure you wait another 10 minutes if the patient doesnt breathe hes dead well now we have ventilators we have heart pacemakers so its much more difficult to define what death is typically death is defined as the end of life and life is defined before death okay so we dont have really very good definitions intelligence we dont have a rigorous definition we know something how to measure its called iq or g factors right and were beginning to build it in a narrow sense right like go alphago and watson and you know google cars and uber cars and all of that its still narrow ai and some people are thinking about artificial general intelligence but roughly as we said before its something to do with ability to learn and to adapt to new environments but that is as i said also its radical difference from experience and its very unclear if you build a machine that has agi its not at all a priori its not at all clear that this machine will have consciousness it may or may not so lets ask it the other way do you think if you were to try to build an artificial general intelligence system do you think figuring out how to build artificial consciousness would help you get to an agi so or put another way do you think intelligent requires consciousness in human it goes hand in hand in human or i think in biology consciousness intelligence goes hand in hand quay is illusion because the brain evolved to be highly complex complexity via the theory integrated information theory is sort of ultimately is what is closely tied to consciousness ultimately its causal power upon itself and so in evolved systems they go together in artificial system particularly in digital machines they do not go together and if you ask me point blank is alexa 200 in the year 2040 when she can easily pass every turing test is she conscious no even if she claims shes conscious in fact you could even do a more radical version of this thought experiment you can build a computer simulation of the human brain you know what henry markham in the blue brain project or the human brain project in switzerland is trying to do lets grant them all the success so in 10 years we have this perfect simulation of the human brain every neuron is simulated and it has a larynx and it has motor neurons it has a brocas area and of course theyll talk and theyll say hi i just woke up i feel great ok even that computer simulation that can in principle map onto your brain will not be conscious why because it simulates its a difference between the simulated and the real so it simulates the behavior associated with consciousness it might be it will if its done properly will have all the intelligence that that particular person theyre simulating has but simulating intelligence is not the same as having conscious experiences and i give you a really nice metaphor that engineers and physicists typically get i can write down einsteins field equation nine or ten equations that describe the link in general relativity between curvature and mass i can do that i can run this on my laptop to predict that the central the black hole at the center of our galaxy will be so massive that it will twist space time around it so no light can escape its a black hole but funny have you ever wondered why doesnt this computer simulation suck me in it simulates gravity but it doesnt have the causal power of gravity thats a huge difference so its a difference between the real and the simulator just like it doesnt get wet inside a computer when the computer runs code that simulates a weather storm and so in order to have to have artificial consciousness you have to give it the same causal power as the human brain you have to build so called a neuromorphic machine that has hardware that is very similar to the human brain not a digital clocked phenomenon computer so thats just to clarify though you think that consciousness is not required to create human level intelligence it seems to accompany in the human brain but for machine not thats correct so maybe just because this is agi lets dig in a little bit about what we mean by intelligence so one thing is the g factor these kind of iq tests of intelligence but i think if you maybe another way to say so in 2040 2050 people will have siri that is just really impressive do you think people will say siri is intelligent yes intelligence is this amorphous thing so to be intelligent it seems like you have to have some kind of connections with other human beings in a sense that you have to impress them with your intelligence and there feels you have to somehow operate in this world full of humans and for that there feels like there has to be something like consciousness so you think you can have just the worlds best natural nlp system natural language understanding generation and that will be that will get us happy and say you know what weve created an agi i dont know happy but yes i do believe we can get what we call high level functional intelligence particular sort of the g you know this fluid like intelligence that we cherish particularly at a place like mit right in machines i see a priori no reasons and i see a lot of reason to believe its going to happen very you know over the next 50 years or 30 years so for beneficial ai for creating an ai system thats so you mentioned ethics that is exceptionally intelligent but also does not do does you know aligns its values with our values as humanity do you think then it needs consciousness yes i think that that is a very good argument that if were concerned about ai and the threat of ai a la nick bostrom existentialist threat i think having an intelligence that has empathy right why do we find abusing a dog why do most of us find that abhorrent abusing any animal right why do we find that abhorrent because we have this thing called empathy which if you look at the greek really means feeling with i feel a path of empathy i have feeling with you i see somebody else suffer that isnt even my conspecific its not a person its not my wife or my kids its a dog but i feel naturally most of us not all of us most of us will feel emphatic and so it may well be in the long term interest of survival of homo sapiens sapiens that if we do build agi and it really becomes very powerful that it has an emphatic response and doesnt just exterminate humanity so as part of the full conscious experience to create a consciousness artificial or in our human consciousness do you think fear maybe were going to get into the earlier days with nietzsche and so on but do you think fear and suffering are essential to have consciousness do you have to have the full range of experience to have a system that has experience or can you have a system that only has very particular kinds of very positive experiences look you can have in principle people have done this in the rat where you implant an electrode in the hypothalamus the pleasure center of the rat and the rat stimulates itself above and beyond anything else it doesnt care about food or natural sex or drink anymore it just stimulates itself because its such a pleasurable feeling i guess its like an orgasm just you have all day long and so a priori i see no reason why you need a great variety now clearly to survive that wouldnt work right but if id engineered artificially i dont think you need a great variety of conscious experience you could have just pleasure or just fear it might be a terrible existence but i think thats possible at least on conceptual logical ground because any real creature whether artificially engineered you want to give it fear the fear of extinction that we all have and you also want to give it positive repetitive states states that you want the machine encouraged to do because they give the machine positive feedback so you mentioned panpsychism to jump back a little bit everything having some kind of mental property how do you go from there to something like human consciousness so everything having some elements of consciousness is there something special about human consciousness so its not everything like a spoon the form of panpsychism i think about doesnt ascribe consciousness to anything like this the spoon on my liver however the theory the integrated information theory does say that the system even one that looks from the outside relatively simple at least if they have this internal causal power it does feel like something the theory a priori doesnt say anything whats special about human biologically we know the one thing thats special about human is we speak and we have an overblown sense of our own importance we believe were exceptional and were just gods gift to the universe but behaviorally the main thing that we have we can plan over the long term we have language and that gives us an enormous amount of power and thats why we are the current dominant species on the planet so you mentioned god you grew up a devout roman catholic family so with consciousness youre sort of exploring some really deeply fundamental human things that religion also touches on where does religion fit into your thinking about consciousness youve grown throughout your life and changed your views on religion as far as i understand yeah i mean im now much closer to im not a roman catholic anymore i dont believe theres sort of this god the god i was educated to believe in sits somewhere in the fullness of time ill be united in some sort of everlasting bliss i just dont see any evidence for that look the world the night is large and full of wonders there are many things that i dont understand i think many things that we as a cult look we dont even understand more than 4 of all the universe dark matter dark energy we have no idea what it is maybe its lost socks what do i know so all i can tell you is its sort of my current religious or spiritual sentiment is much closer to some form of buddhism without the reincarnation unfortunately theres no evidence for it than reincarnation so can you describe the way buddhism sees the world a little bit well so they talk about so when i spent several meetings with the dalai lama and what always impressed me about him he really unlike for example lets say the pope or some cardinal he always emphasized minimizing the suffering of all creatures so they have this from the early beginning they look at suffering in all creatures not just in people but in everybody this universal and of course by degrees an animal in general is less capable of suffering than a well developed normally developed human and they think consciousness pervades in this universe and they have these techniques you can think of them like mindfulness etc and meditation that tries to access what they claim of this more fundamental aspect of reality im not sure its more fundamental i think about it theres the physical and then theres this inside view consciousness and those are the two aspects thats the only thing i have access to in my life and youve got to remember my conscious experience and your conscious experience comes prior to anything you know about physics comes prior to knowledge about the universe and atoms and super strings and molecules and all of that the only thing you directly are acquainted with is this world thats populated with things in images and sounds in your head and touches and all of that i actually have a question so it sounds like you kind of have a rich life you talk about rock climbing and it seems like you really love literature and consciousness is all about experiencing things so do you think that has helped your research on this topic yes particularly if you think about it the various states so for example when you do rock climbing or now i do rowing crew rowing and a bike every day you can get into this thing called the zone and ive always wanted about it particularly with respect to consciousness because its a strangely addictive state once people have it once they want to keep on going back to it and you wonder what is it so addicting about it and i think its the experience of almost close to pure experience because in this zone youre not conscious of inner voice anymore theres always inner voice nagging you you have to do this you have to do that you have to pay your taxes you have to fight with your ex and all of those things theyre always there but when youre in the zone all of that is gone and youre just in this wonderful state where youre fully out in the world youre climbing or youre rowing or biking or doing soccer or whatever youre doing and sort of consciousness is this youre all action or in this case of pure experience youre not action at all but in both cases you experience some aspect of conscious you touch some basic part of conscious existence that is so basic and so deeply satisfying you i think you touch the root of being thats really what youre touching there youre getting close to the root of being and thats very different from intelligence so what do you think about the simulation hypothesis simulation theory the idea that we all live in a computer simulation rapture for nerds rapture for nerds i think its as likely as the hypothesis had engaged hundreds of scholars for many centuries are we all just existing in the mind of god and this is just a modern version of it its equally plausible people love talking about these sort of things i know theyre book written about this simulation hypothesis if thats what people want to do thats fine it seems rather esoteric its never testable but its not useful for you to think of in those terms so maybe connecting to the questions of free will which youve talked about i vaguely remember you saying that the idea that theres no free will it makes you very uncomfortable so what do you think about free will from a physics perspective from a conscious perspective what does it all fit okay so from the physics perspective leaving aside quantum mechanics we believe we live in a fully deterministic world right but then comes of course quantum mechanics so now we know that certain things are in principle not predictable which as you said i prefer because the idea that the initial condition of the universe and then everything else were just acting out the initial condition of the universe that doesntâ€¦ its not a romantic notion certainly not now when it comes to consciousness i think we do have certain freedom we are much more constrained by physics of course and by our past and by our own conscious desires and what our parents told us and what our environment tells us we all know that right theres hundreds of experiments that show how we can be influenced but finally in the final analysis when you make a life â€“ and im talking really about critical decision where you really think should i marry should i go to this school or that school should i take this job or that job should i cheat on my taxes or not these are things where you really deliberate and i think under those conditions you are as free as you can be when you bring your entire being your entire conscious being to that question and try to analyze it under all the various conditions then you make a decision you are as free as you can ever be that is i think what free will is its not a will thats totally free to do anything it wants thats not possible right so as jack mentioned you actually write a blog about books youve read amazing books from im russian from bulgakov neil gaiman carl sagan murakami so what is a book that early in your life transformed the way you saw the world something that changed your life nietzsche i guess did thats brooks r truster because he talks about some of these problems he was one of the first discoverer of the unconscious this is a little bit before freud when he was in the air he makes all these claims that people sort of under the guise or under the mass of charity actually are very noncharitable so he is sort of really the first discoverer of the great land of the unconscious and that really struck me and what do you think about the unconscious what do you think about freud what do you think about these ideas just like dark matter in the universe whats over there in that unconscious a lot i mean much more than we think this is what a lot of last 100 years of research has shown so i think he was a genius misguided towards the end but he started out as a neuroscientist he contributed he did the studies on the lamprey he contributed himself to the neuron hypothesis the idea that there are discrete units that we call nerve cells now and then he wrote about the unconscious and i think its true theres lots of stuff happening you feel this particular when youre in a relationship and it breaks asunder right and then you have this terrible you can have love and hate and lust and anger and all of its mixed in and when you try to analyze yourself why am i so upset its very very difficult to penetrate to those basements those caverns in your mind because the prying eyes of conscious doesnt have access to those but theyre there in the amygdala or lots of other places they make you upset or angry or sad or depressed and its very difficult to try to actually uncover the reason you can go to a shrink you can talk with your friend endlessly you construct finally a story why this happened why you love her or dont love her or whatever but you dont really know whether that actually happened because you simply dont have access to those parts of the brain and theyre very powerful do you think thats a feature or a bug of our brain the fact that we have this deep difficult to dive into subconscious i think its a feature because otherwise look we are like any other brain or nervous system or computer we are severely band limited if everything i do every emotion i feel every eye movements i make if all of that had to be under the control of consciousness i wouldnt be here what you do early on your brain you have to be conscious when you learn things like typing or like riding on a bike but then what you do you train up routes i think that involve basal ganglia and striatum you train up different parts of your brain and then once you do it automatically like typing you can show you do it much faster without even thinking about it because youve got these highly specialized what frans krik and i call zombie agents theyre taking care of that while your consciousness can sort of worry about the abstract sense of the text you want to write i think thats true for many many things but for the things like all the fights you had with an ex girlfriend things that you would think are not useful to still linger somewhere in the subconscious so that seems like a bug that it would stick to there you think it would be better if you can analyze it and then get it out of the system better to get it out of the system or just forget it ever happened that seems a very buggy kind of well yeah in general we dont have and thats probably functional we dont have an ability unless its extreme there are cases clinical dissociations right when people are heavily abused when they completely repress the memory but that doesnt happen in normal people we dont have an ability to remove traumatic memories and of course we suffer from that on the other hand probably if you had the ability to constantly wipe your memory youd probably do it to an extent that isnt useful to you so yeah its a good question to balance so on the books as jack mentioned correct me if im wrong but broadly speaking academia and the different scientific disciplines certainly in engineering reading literature seems to be a rare pursuit so im wrong on this but thats in my experience most people read much more technical text and do not sort of escape or seek truth in literature it seems like you do so what do you think is the value what do you think literature adds to the pursuit of scientific truth do you think its good its useful for everybody gives you access to a much wider array of human experiences how valuable do you think it is well if you want to understand human nature and nature in general then i think you have to better understand a wide variety of experiences not just sitting in a lab staring at a screen and having a face flashed onto you for a hundred milliseconds and pushing a button thats what i used to do thats what most psychologists do theres nothing wrong with that but you need to consider lots of other strange states and literature is a shortcut for this well yeah because literature thats what literature is all about all sorts of interesting experiences that people have the contingency of it the fact that women experience the world different black people experience the world different the one way to experience that is reading all these different literature and try to find out you see everything is so relative you read a book 300 years ago they thought about certain problems very very differently than us today we today like any culture think we know it all thats common to every culture every culture believes at its heyday they know it all and then you realize well theres other ways of viewing the universe and some of them may have lots of things in their favor so this is a question i wanted to ask about time scale or scale in general when you with iit or in general try to think about consciousness try to think about these ideas we kind of naturally think in human time scales and also entities that are sized close to humans do you think of things that are much larger and much smaller as containing consciousness and do you think of things that take you know eons to operate in their conscious cause effect thats a very good question so i think a lot about small creatures because experimentally you know a lot of people work on flies and bees right so most people just think they are automata theyre just bugs for heavens sake right but if you look at their behavior like bees they can recognize individual humans they have this very complicated way to communicate if youve ever been involved or you know your parents when they bought a house what sort of agonizing decision that is and bees have to do that once a year right when they swarm in the spring and then they have this very elaborate way they have free and scouts they go to the individual sites they come back they have this power this dance literally where they dance for several days they try to recruit other deets this very complicated decision rate when they finally once they make a decision the entire swarm the scouts warm up the entire swarm and then go to one location they dont go to 50 locations they go to one location that the scouts have agreed upon by themselves thats awesome if we look at the circuit complexity its 10 times more denser than anything we have in our brain now they only have a million neurons but the neurons are amazingly complex complex behavior very complicated circuitry so theres no question they experience something their life is very different theyre tiny they only live you know for well workers live maybe for two months so i think and iit tells you this in principle the substrate of consciousness is the substrate that maximizes the cause effect power over all possible spatial temporal grains so when i think about for example do you know the science fiction story the black cloud okay its a classic by fred hoyle the astronomer he has this cloud intervening between the earth and the sun and leading to some sort of to global cooling this is written in the 50s it turns out you can using the radio dish they communicate with actually an entity its actually an intelligent entity and they sort of they convince it to move away so here you have a radical different entity and in principle iit says well you can measure the integrated information in principle at least and yes if the maximum of that occurs at a time scale of months rather than in assets for a fraction of a second yes then they would experience life where each moment is a month rather than or microsecond right rather than a fraction of a second in the human case and so there may be forms of consciousness that we simply dont recognize for what they are because they are so radical different from anything you and i are used to again thats why its good to read or to watch science fiction movies well to think about this do you know stanislav lem this polish science fiction writer he wrote solaris and was turned into a hollywood movie yes his best novel is in the 60s a very engineer hes an engineer in background his most interesting novel is called the victorious where human civilization they have this mission to this planet and everything is destroyed and they discover machines humans got killed and then these machines took over and there was this machine evolution darwinian evolution he talks about this very vividly and finally the dominant machine intelligence organism that survived were gigantic clouds of little hexagonal universal cellular automata this was written in the 60s so typically theyre all lying on the ground individual by themselves but in times of crisis they can communicate they assemble into gigantic nets into clouds of trillions of these particles and then they become hyper intelligent and they can beat anything that humans can throw at it its very beautiful and compelling where you have an intelligence where finally the humans leave the planet theyre simply unable to understand and comprehend this creature they can say well either we can nuke the entire planet and destroy it or we just have to leave because fundamentally its an alien its so alien from us and our ideas that we cannot communicate with them yeah actually in conversation so youre talking to us steven wolf from brought up is that there could be ideas that you already have these artificial general intelligence like super smart or maybe conscious beings in the cellular automata we just dont know how to talk to them so its the language of communication but you dont know what to do with it so thats one sort of view is consciousness is only something you can measure so its not conscious if you cant measure it so youre making an ontological and an epistemic statement one is its just like seeing the multiverses that might be true but i cant communicate with them i cant have any knowledge of them thats an epistemic argument right so those are two different things so it may well be possible look in another case thats happening right now people are building these mini organoids do you know what this is so you can take stem cells from under your arm put it in a dish add four transcription factors and then you can induce them to grow into large well large theyre a few millimeters theyre like a half a million neurons that look like nerve cells in a dish called mini organoids at harvard at stanford everywhere theyre building them it may well be possible that theyre beginning to feel like something but we cant really communicate with them right now so people are beginning to think about the ethics of this so yes he may be perfectly right but its one question are they conscious or not its a totally separate question how would i know those are two different things if you could give advice to a young researcher sort of dreaming of understanding or creating human level intelligence or consciousness what would you say just follow your dreams read widely no i mean i suppose with discipline what is the pursuit that they should take on is it neuroscience is it computational cognitive science is it philosophy is it computer science or robotics no in a sense that okay so the only known system that have high level of intelligence is homo sapiens so if you wanted to build it its probably good to continue to study closely what humans do so cognitive neuroscience you know somewhere between cognitive neuroscience on the one hand and some philosophy of mind and then ai ai computer science you can look at all the original ideas in your network they all came from neuroscience right reinforce whether its snarky minsky building is snarky or whether its you know the early hubel and wiesel experiments at harvard that then gave rise to networks and then multi layer networks so it may well be possible in fact some people argue that to make the next big step in ai once we realize the limits of deep convolutional networks they can do certain things but they cant really understand they dont they cant really i cant really show them one image i can show you a single image of somebody a pickpocket who steals a wallet from a purse you immediately know thats a pickpocket now computer system would just say well its a man its a woman its a purse right unless you train this machine on showing it a hundred thousand pickpockets right so it doesnt have this easy understanding that you have right so some people make the argument in order to go to the next step or you really want to build machines that understand in a way you and i we have to go to psychology we need to understand how we do it and how our brains enable us to do it and so therefore being on the cusp its also so exciting to try to understand better our nature and then to build to take some of those inside and build them so i think the most exciting thing is somewhere in the interface between cognitive science neuroscience ai computer science and philosophy of mind beautiful yeah id say if there is from the machine learning from our from the computer science computer vision perspective many of the researchers kind of ignore the way the human brain works or even psychology or literature or studying the brain i would hope josh tenenbaum talks about bringing that in more and more and thats yeah so youve worked on some amazing stuff throughout your life whats the thing that youre really excited about whats the mystery that you would love to uncover in the near term beyond beyond all the mysteries that youre already surrounded by well so theres a structure called the claustrum this is a structure its underneath our cortex its yay big you have one on the left on the right underneath this underneath the insula its very thin its like one millimeter its embedded in in wiring in white matter so its very difficult to image and it has it has connection to every cortical region and francis crick the last paper he ever wrote he dictated corrections the day he died in hospital on this paper you know we hypothesize well because it has this unique anatomy it gets input from every cortical area and projects back to every every cortical area that the function of this structure is similar its just a metaphor to the role of a conductor in a symphony orchestra you have all the different cortical players you have some that do motion some that do theory of mind some that infer social interaction and color and hearing and all the different modules in cortex but of course what consciousness is consciousness puts it all together into one package right the binding problem all of that and this is really the function because it has relatively few neurons compared to cortex but it talks it receives input from all of them and it projects back to all of them and so were testing that right now weve got this beautiful neuronal reconstruction in the mouse called crown of thorns crown of thorns neurons that are in the claustrum that have the most widespread connection of any neuron ive ever seen theyre very you have individual neurons that sit in the claustrum tiny but then they have this single neuron they have this huge axonal tree that cover both ipsy and contralateral cortex and trying to turn using you know fancy tools like optogenetics trying to turn those neurons on or off and study it what happens in the in the mouse so this thing is perhaps where the parts become the whole perhaps its one of the structures its a very good way of putting it where the individual parts turn into the whole of the whole of the conscious experience well with that thank you very much for being here today thank you very much thank you very much all right thank you very much', 'youve studied the human mind cognition language vision evolution psychology from child to adult from the level of individual to the level of our entire civilization so i feel like i can start with a simple multiple choice question what is the meaning of life is it a to attain knowledge as plato said b to attain power as nietzsche said c to escape death as ernest becker said d to propagate our genes as darwin and others have said e there is no meaning as the nihilists have said f knowing the meaning of life is beyond our cognitive capabilities as stephen pinker said based on my interpretation 20 years ago and g none of the above id say a comes closest but i would amend that to c to attaining not only knowledge but fulfillment more generally that is life health stimulation access to the living cultural and social world now this is our meaning of life its not the meaning of life if you were to ask our genes their meaning is to propagate copies of themselves but that is distinct from the meaning that the brain that they lead to sets for itself so to you knowledge is a small subset or a large subset its a large subset but its not the entirety of human striving because we also want to interact with people we want to experience beauty we want to experience the richness of the natural world but understanding what makes the universe tick is way up there for some of us more than others certainly for me thats one of the top five so is that a fundamental aspect are you just describing your own preference or is this a fundamental aspect of human nature is to seek knowledge in your latest book you talk about the power the usefulness of rationality and reason and so on is that a fundamental nature of human beings or is it something we should just strive for both were capable of striving for it because it is one of the things that make us what we are homo sapiens wise men we are unusual among animals in the degree to which we acquire knowledge and use it to survive we make tools we strike agreements via language we extract poisons we predict the behavior of animals we try to get at the workings of plants and when i say we i dont just mean we in the modern west but we as a species everywhere which is how weve managed to occupy every niche on the planet how weve managed to drive other animals to extinction and the refinement of reason in pursuit of human wellbeing of health happiness social richness cultural richness is our main challenge in the present that is using our intellect using our knowledge to figure out how the world works how we work in order to make discoveries and strike agreements that make us all better off in the long run right and you do that almost undeniably and in a data driven way in your recent book but id like to focus on the artificial intelligence aspect of things and not just artificial intelligence but natural intelligence too so 20 years ago in a book youve written on how the mind works you conjecture again am i right to interpret things you can correct me if im wrong but you conjecture that human thought in the brain may be a result of a massive network of highly interconnected neurons so from this interconnectivity emerges thought compared to artificial neural networks which we use for machine learning today is there something fundamentally more complex mysterious even magical about the biological neural networks versus the ones weve been starting to use over the past 60 years and have become to success in the past 10 there is something a little bit mysterious about the human neural networks which is that each one of us who is a neural network knows that we ourselves are conscious conscious not in the sense of registering our surroundings or even registering our internal state but in having subjective first person present tense experience that is when i see red its not just different from green but theres a redness to it that i feel whether an artificial system would experience that or not i dont know and i dont think i can know thats why its mysterious if we had a perfectly lifelike robot that was behaviorally indistinguishable from a human would we attribute consciousness to it or ought we to attribute consciousness to it and thats something that its very hard to know but putting that aside putting aside that largely philosophical question the question is is there some difference between the human neural network and the ones that were building in artificial intelligence will mean that were on the current trajectory not going to reach the point where weve got a lifelike robot indistinguishable from a human because the way their so called neural networks are organized are different from the way ours are organized i think theres overlap but i think there are some big differences that current neural networks current so called deep learning systems are in reality not all that deep that is they are very good at extracting high order statistical regularities but most of the systems dont have a semantic level a level of actual understanding of who did what to whom why where how things work what causes what else do you think that kind of thing can emerge as it does so artificial neural networks are much smaller the number of connections and so on than the current human biological networks but do you think sort of to go to consciousness or to go to this higher level semantic reasoning about things do you think that can emerge with just a larger network with a more richly weirdly interconnected network separate it in consciousness because consciousness is even a matter of complexity a really weird one yeah you could sensibly ask the question of whether shrimp are conscious for example theyre not terribly complex but maybe they feel pain so lets just put that part of it aside but i think sheer size of a neural network is not enough to give it structure and knowledge but if its suitably engineered then why not that is were neural networks natural selection did a kind of equivalent of engineering of our brains so i dont think theres anything mysterious in the sense that no system made out of silicon could ever do what a human brain can do i think its possible in principle whether itll ever happen depends not only on how clever we are in engineering these systems but whether we even want to whether thats even a sensible goal that is you can ask the question is there any locomotion system that is as good as a human well we kind of want to do better than a human ultimately in terms of legged locomotion theres no reason that humans should be our benchmark theyre tools that might be better in some ways it may be that we cant duplicate a natural system because at some point its so much cheaper to use a natural system that were not going to invest more brainpower and resources so for example we dont really have an exact substitute for wood we still build houses out of wood we still build furniture out of wood we like the look we like the feel it has certain properties that synthetics dont its not that theres anything magical or mysterious about wood its just that the extra steps of duplicating everything about wood is something we just havent bothered because we have wood likewise say cotton im wearing cotton clothing now it feels much better than polyester its not that cotton has something magic in it its not that we couldnt ever synthesize something exactly like cotton but at some point its just not worth it weve got cotton likewise in the case of human intelligence the goal of making an artificial system that is exactly like the human brain is a goal that we probably know is going to pursue to the bitter end i suspect because if you want tools that do things better than humans youre not going to care whether it does something like humans so for example diagnosing cancer or predicting the weather why set humans as your benchmark but in general i suspect you also believe that even if the human should not be a benchmark and we dont want to imitate humans in their system theres a lot to be learned about how to create an artificial intelligence system by studying the human yeah i think thats right in the same way that to build flying machines we want to understand the laws of aerodynamics including birds but not mimic the birds but theyre the same laws you have a view on ai artificial intelligence and safety that from my perspective is refreshingly rational or perhaps more importantly has elements of positivity to it which i think can be inspiring and empowering as opposed to paralyzing for many people including ai researchers the eventual existential threat of ai is obvious not only possible but obvious and for many others including ai researchers the threat is not obvious so elon musk is famously in the highly concerned about ai camp saying things like ai is far more dangerous than nuclear weapons and that ai will likely destroy human civilization human civilization so in february he said that if elon was really serious about ai the threat of ai he would stop building self driving cars that hes doing very successfully as part of tesla then he said wow if even pinker doesnt understand the difference between narrow ai like a car and general ai when the latter literally has a million times more compute power and an open ended utility function humanity is in deep trouble so first what did you mean by the statement about elon musk should stop building self driving cars if hes deeply concerned not the last time that elon musk has fired off an intemperate tweet well we live in a world where twitter has power yes yeah i think there are two kinds of existential threat that have been discussed in connection with artificial intelligence and i think that theyre both incoherent one of them is a vague fear of ai takeover that just as we subjugated animals and less technologically advanced peoples so if we build something thats more advanced than us it will inevitably turn us into pets or slaves or domesticated animal equivalents i think this confuses intelligence with a will to power that it so happens that in the intelligence system we are most familiar with namely homo sapiens we are products of natural selection which is a competitive process and so bundled together with our problem solving capacity are a number of nasty traits like dominance and exploitation and maximization of power and glory and resources and influence theres no reason to think that sheer problem solving capability will set that as one of its goals its goals will be whatever we set its goals as and as long as someone isnt building a megalomaniacal artificial intelligence then theres no reason to think that it would naturally evolve in that direction now you might say well what if we gave it the goal of maximizing its own power source thats a pretty stupid goal to give an autonomous system you dont give it that goal i mean thats just self evidently idiotic so if you look at the history of the world theres been a lot of opportunities where engineers could instill in a system destructive power and they choose not to because thats the natural process of engineering well except for weapons i mean if youre building a weapon its goal is to destroy people and so i think there are good reasons to not build certain kinds of weapons i think building nuclear weapons was a massive mistake you do so maybe pause on that because that is one of the serious threats do you think that it was a mistake in a sense that it should have been stopped early on or do you think its just an unfortunate event of invention that this was invented do you think its possible to stop i guess is the question its hard to rewind the clock because of course it was invented in the context of world war ii and the fear that the nazis might develop one first then once it was initiated for that reason it was hard to turn off especially since winning the war against the japanese and the nazis was such an overwhelming goal of every responsible person that theres just nothing that people wouldnt have done then to ensure victory its quite possible if world war ii hadnt happened that nuclear weapons wouldnt have been invented we cant know but i dont think it was by any means a necessity any more than some of the other weapon systems that were envisioned but never implemented like planes that would disperse poison gas over cities like crop dusters or systems to try to create earthquakes and tsunamis in enemy countries to weaponize the weather weaponize solar flares all kinds of crazy schemes that we thought the better of i think analogies between nuclear weapons and artificial intelligence are fundamentally misguided because the whole point of nuclear weapons is to destroy things the point of artificial intelligence is not to destroy things so the analogy is misleading so theres two artificial intelligence you mentioned the first one i guess is highly intelligent or power hungry yeah its a system that we design ourselves where we give it the goals goals are external to the means to attain the goals if we dont design an artificially intelligent system to maximize dominance then it wont maximize dominance its just that were so familiar with homo sapiens where these two traits come bundled together particularly in men that we are apt to confuse high intelligence with a will to power but thats just an error the other fear is that will be collateral damage that will give artificial intelligence a goal like make paper clips and it will pursue that goal so brilliantly that before we can stop it it turns us into paper clips well give it the goal of curing cancer and it will turn us into guinea pigs for lethal experiments or give it the goal of world peace and its conception of world peace is no people therefore no fighting and so it will kill us all now i think these are utterly fanciful in fact i think theyre actually self defeating they first of all assume that were going to be so brilliant that we can design an artificial intelligence that can cure cancer but so stupid that we dont specify what we mean by curing cancer in enough detail that it wont kill us in the process and it assumes that the system will be so smart that it can cure cancer but so idiotic that it cant figure out that what we mean by curing cancer is not killing everyone i think that the collateral damage scenario the value alignment problem is also based on a misconception so one of the challenges of course we dont know how to build either system currently or are we even close to knowing of course those things can change overnight but at this time theorizing about it is very challenging in either direction so thats probably at the core of the problem is without that ability to reason about the real engineering things here at hand is your imagination runs away with things exactly but let me sort of ask what do you think was the motivation the thought process of elon musk i build autonomous vehicles i study autonomous vehicles i study tesla autopilot i think it is one of the greatest currently large scale application of artificial intelligence in the world it has potentially a very positive impact on society so how does a person whos creating this very good quote unquote narrow ai system also seem to be so concerned about this other general ai what do you think is the motivation there what do you think is the thing well you probably have to ask him but there and he is notoriously flamboyant impulsive to the as we have just seen to the detriment of his own goals of the health of the company so i dont know whats going on in his mind you probably have to ask him but i dont think the and i dont think the distinction between special purpose ai and so called general ai is relevant that in the same way that special purpose ai is not going to do anything conceivable in order to attain a goal all engineering systems are designed to trade off across multiple goals when we build cars in the first place we didnt forget to install brakes because the goal of a car is to go fast it occurred to people yes you want it to go fast but not always so you would build in brakes too likewise if a car is going to be autonomous and program it to take the shortest route to the airport its not going to take the diagonal and mow down people and trees and fences because thats the shortest route thats not what we mean by the shortest route when we program it and thats just what an intelligence system is by definition it takes into account multiple constraints the same is true in fact even more true of so called general intelligence that is if its genuinely intelligent its not going to pursue some goal singlemindedly omitting every other consideration and collateral effect thats not artificial and general intelligence thats artificial stupidity i agree with you by the way on the promise of autonomous vehicles for improving human welfare i think its spectacular and im surprised at how little press coverage notes that in the united states alone something like 40000 people die every year on the highways vastly more than are killed by terrorists and we spent a trillion dollars on a war to combat deaths by terrorism about half a dozen a year whereas year in year out 40000 people are massacred on the highways which could be brought down to very close to zero so im with you on the humanitarian benefit let me just mention that as a person whos building these cars it is a little bit offensive to me to say that engineers would be clueless enough not to engineer safety into systems i often stay up at night thinking about those 40000 people that are dying and everything i tried to engineer is to save those peoples lives so every new invention that im super excited about in all the deep learning literature and cvpr conferences and nips everything im super excited about is all grounded in making it safe and help people so i just dont see how that trajectory can all of a sudden slip into a situation where intelligence will be highly negative you and i certainly agree on that and i think thats only the beginning of the potential humanitarian benefits of artificial intelligence theres been enormous attention to what are we going to do with the people whose jobs are made obsolete by artificial intelligence but very little attention given to the fact that the jobs that are going to be made obsolete are horrible jobs the fact that people arent going to be picking crops and making beds and driving trucks and mining coal these are soul deadening jobs and we have a whole literature sympathizing with the people stuck in these menial mind deadening dangerous jobs if we can eliminate them this is a fantastic boon to humanity now granted you solve one problem and theres another one namely how do we get these people a decent income but if were smart enough to invent machines that can make beds and put away dishes and handle hospital patients i think were smart enough to figure out how to redistribute income to apportion some of the vast economic savings to the human beings who will no longer be needed to make beds okay sam harris says that its obvious that eventually ai will be an existential risk hes one of the people who says its obvious we dont know when the claim goes but eventually its obvious and because we dont know when we should worry about it now this is a very interesting argument in my eyes so how do we think about timescale how do we think about existential threats when we dont really we know so little about the threat unlike nuclear weapons perhaps about this particular threat that it could happen tomorrow right so but very likely it wont very likely itd be a hundred years away so how do we ignore it how do we talk about it do we worry about it how do we think about those what is it a threat that we can imagine its within the limits of our imagination but not within our limits of understanding to accurately predict it but what is the it that were afraid of sorry ai being the existential threat ai how like enslaving us or turning us into paperclips i think the most compelling from the sam harris perspective would be the paperclip situation yeah i mean i just think its totally fanciful i mean that is dont build a system dont give a dont first of all the code of engineering is you dont implement a system with massive control before testing it now perhaps the culture of engineering will radically change then i would worry but i dont see any signs that engineers will suddenly do idiotic things like put a electric power plant in control of a system that they havent tested first or all of these scenarios not only imagine almost a magically powered intelligence including things like cure cancer which is probably an incoherent goal because theres so many different kinds of cancer or bring about world peace i mean how do you even specify that as a goal but the scenarios also imagine some degree of control of every molecule in the universe which not only is itself unlikely but we would not start to connect these systems to infrastructure without testing as we would any kind of engineering system now maybe some engineers will be irresponsible and we need legal and regulatory and legal responsibility implemented so that engineers dont do things that are stupid by their own standards but the ive never seen enough of a plausible scenario of existential threat to devote large amounts of brain power to to forestall it so you believe in the sort of the power on mass of the engineering of reason as you argue in your latest book of reason and science to sort of be the very thing that guides the development of new technology so its safe and also keeps us safe you know granted the same culture of safety that currently is part of the engineering mindset for airplanes for example so yeah i dont think that that should be thrown out the window and that untested all powerful systems should be suddenly implemented but theres no reason to think they are and in fact if you look at the progress of artificial intelligence its been you know its been impressive especially in the last 10 years or so but the idea that suddenly therell be a step function that all of a sudden before we know it it will be all powerful that therell be some kind of recursive self improvement some kind of fume is also fanciful we certainly by the technology that we that were now impresses us such as deep learning where you train something on hundreds of thousands or millions of examples theyre not hundreds of thousands of problems of which curing cancer is a typical example and so the kind of techniques that have allowed ai to increase in the last five years are not the kind that are going to lead to this fantasy of exponential sudden self improvement i think its kind of a magical thinking its not based on our understanding of how ai actually works now give me a chance here so you said fanciful magical thinking in his ted talk sam harris says that thinking about ai killing all human civilization is somehow fun intellectually now i have to say as a scientist engineer i dont find it fun but when im having beer with my non ai friends there is indeed something fun and appealing about it like talking about an episode of black mirror considering if a large meteor is headed towards earth we were just told a large meteor is headed towards earth something like this and can you relate to this sense of fun and do you understand the psychology of it yes good question i personally dont find it fun i find it kind of actually a waste of time because there are genuine threats that we ought to be thinking about like pandemics like cyber security vulnerabilities like the possibility of nuclear war and certainly climate change you know this is enough to fill many conversations and i think sam did put his finger on something namely that there is a community sometimes called the rationality community that delights in using its brainpower to come up with scenarios that would not occur to mere mortals to less cerebral people so there is a kind of intellectual thrill in finding new things to worry about that no one has worried about yet i actually think though that its not only is it a kind of fun that doesnt give me particular pleasure but i think there can be a pernicious side to it namely that you overcome people with such dread such fatalism that there are so many ways to die to annihilate our civilization that we may as well enjoy life while we can theres nothing we can do about it if climate change doesnt do us in then runaway robots will so lets enjoy ourselves now weve got to prioritize we have to look at threats that are close to certainty such as climate change and distinguish those from ones that are merely imaginable but with infinitesimal probabilities and we have to take into account peoples worry budget you cant worry about everything and if you sow dread and fear and terror and fatalism it can lead to a kind of numbness well these problems are overwhelming and the engineers are just going to kill us all so lets either destroy the entire infrastructure of science technology or lets just enjoy life while we can so theres a certain line of worry which im worried about a lot of things in engineering theres a certain line of worry when you cross youre allowed to cross that it becomes paralyzing fear as opposed to productive fear and thats kind of what youre highlighting exactly right and weve seen some we know that human effort is not well calibrated against risk in that because a basic tenet of cognitive psychology is that perception of risk and hence perception of fear is driven by imaginability not by data and so we misallocate vast amounts of resources to avoiding terrorism which kills on average about six americans a year with one exception of 9 11 we invade countries we invent entire new departments of government with massive massive expenditure of resources and lives to defend ourselves against a trivial risk whereas guaranteed risks one of them you mentioned traffic fatalities and even risks that are not here but are plausible enough to worry about like pandemics like nuclear war receive far too little attention in presidential debates theres no discussion of how to minimize the risk of nuclear war lots of discussion of terrorism for example and so i think its essential to calibrate our budget of fear worry concern planning to the actual probability of harm yep so let me ask this question so speaking of imaginability you said its important to think about reason and one of my favorite people who likes to dip into the outskirts of reason through fascinating exploration of his imagination is joe rogan oh yes so who has through reason used to believe a lot of conspiracies and through reason has stripped away a lot of his beliefs in that way so its fascinating actually to watch him through rationality kind of throw away the ideas of bigfoot and 9 11 im not sure exactly kim trails i dont know what he believes in yes okay but he no longer believed in no thats right no hes become a real force for good yep so you were on the joe rogan podcast in february and had a fascinating conversation but as far as i remember didnt talk much about artificial intelligence i will be on his podcast in a couple of weeks joe is very much concerned about existential threat of ai im not sure if youre this is why i was hoping that you would get into that topic and in this way he represents quite a lot of people who look at the topic of ai from 10000 foot level so as an exercise of communication you said its important to be rational and reason about these things let me ask if you were to coach me as an ai researcher about how to speak to joe and the general public about ai what would you advise well the short answer would be to read the sections that i wrote in enlightenment now about ai but a longer reason would be i think to emphasize and i think youre very well positioned as an engineer to remind people about the culture of engineering that it really is safety oriented that another discussion in enlightenment now i plot rates of accidental death from various causes plane crashes car crashes occupational accidents even death by lightning strikes and they all plummet because the culture of engineering is how do you squeeze out the lethal risks death by fire death by drowning death by asphyxiation all of them drastically declined because of advances in engineering that i got to say i did not appreciate until i saw those graphs and it is because exactly people like you who stay up at night thinking oh my god is what im inventing likely to hurt people and to deploy ingenuity to prevent that from happening now im not an engineer although i spent 22 years at mit so i know something about the culture of engineering my understanding is that this is the way you think if youre an engineer and its essential that that culture not be suddenly switched off when it comes to artificial intelligence so i mean that could be a problem but is there any reason to think it would be switched off i dont think so and one theres not enough engineers speaking up for this way for the excitement for the positive view of human nature what youre trying to create is positivity like everything we try to invent is trying to do good for the world but let me ask you about the psychology of negativity it seems just objectively not considering the topic it seems that being negative about the future makes you sound smarter than being positive about the future irregardless of topic am i correct in this observation and if so why do you think that is yeah i think there is that phenomenon that as tom lehrer the satirist said always predict the worst and youll be hailed as a prophet it may be part of our overall negativity bias we are as a species more attuned to the negative than the positive we dread losses more than we enjoy gains and that might open up a space for prophets to remind us of harms and risks and losses that we may have overlooked so i think there is that asymmetry so youve written some of my favorite books all over the place so starting from enlightenment now to the better ages of our nature blank slate how the mind works the one about language language instinct bill gates big fan too said of your most recent book that its my new favorite book of all time so for you as an author what was a book early on in your life that had a profound impact on the way you saw the world certainly this book enlightenment now was influenced by david deutschs the beginning of infinity a rather deep reflection on knowledge and the power of knowledge to improve the human condition and with bits of wisdom such as that problems are inevitable but problems are solvable given the right knowledge and that solutions create new problems that have to be solved in their turn thats i think a kind of wisdom about the human condition that influenced the writing of this book there are some books that are excellent but obscure some of which i have on a page on my website i read a book called the history of force self published by a political scientist named james payne on the historical decline of violence and that was one of the inspirations for the better angels of our nature what about early on if you look back when you were maybe a teenager i loved a book called one two three infinity when i was a young adult i read that book by george gamow the physicist which had very accessible and humorous explanations of relativity of number theory of dimensionality high multiple dimensional spaces in a way that i think is still delightful 70 years after it was published i like the time life science series these are books that would arrive every month that my mother subscribed to each one on a different topic one would be on electricity one would be on forests one would be on evolution and then one was on the mind i was just intrigued that there could be a science of mind and that book i would cite as an influence as well then later on thats when you fell in love with the idea of studying the mind was that the thing that grabbed you it was one of the things i would say i read as a college student the book reflections on language by noam chomsky i spent most of his career here at mit richard dawkins two books the blind watchmaker and the selfish gene were enormously influential mainly for the content but also for the writing style the ability to explain abstract concepts in lively prose stephen jay goulds first collection ever since darwin also an excellent example of lively writing george miller a psychologist that most psychologists are familiar with came up with the idea that human memory has a capacity of seven plus or minus two chunks thats probably his biggest claim to fame but he wrote a couple of books on language and communication that i read as an undergraduate again beautifully written and intellectually deep wonderful stephen thank you so much for taking the time today my pleasure thanks a lot lex', 'what difference between biological neural networks and artificial neural networks is most mysterious captivating and profound for you first of all theres so much we dont know about biological neural networks and thats very mysterious and captivating because maybe it holds the key to improving artificial neural networks one of the things i studied recently is something that we dont know how biological neural networks do but would be really useful for artificial ones is the ability to do credit assignment through very long time spans there are things that we can in principle do with artificial neural nets but its not very convenient and its not biologically plausible and this mismatch i think this kind of mismatch may be an interesting thing to study to a understand better how brains might do these things because we dont have good corresponding theories with artificial neural nets and b maybe provide new ideas that we could explore about things that brain do differently and that we could incorporate in artificial neural nets so lets break credit assignment up a little bit yes so what its a beautifully technical term but it could incorporate so many things so is it more on the rnn memory side that thinking like that or is it something about knowledge building up common sense knowledge over time or is it more in the reinforcement learning sense that youre picking up rewards over time for a particular to achieve a certain kind of goal so i was thinking more about the first two meanings whereby we store all kinds of memories episodic memories in our brain which we can access later in order to help us both infer causes of things that we are observing now and assign credit to decisions or interpretations we came up with a while ago when those memories were stored and then we can change the way we would have reacted or interpreted things in the past and now thats credit assignment used for learning so in which way do you think artificial neural networks the current lstm the current architectures are not able to capture the presumably youre thinking of very long term yes so current the current nets are doing a fairly good jobs for sequences with dozens or say hundreds of time steps and then it gets harder and harder and depending on what you have to remember and so on as you consider longer durations whereas humans seem to be able to do credit assignment through essentially arbitrary times like i could remember something i did last year and then now because i see some new evidence im going to change my mind about the way i was thinking last year and hopefully not do the same mistake again i think a big part of that is probably forgetting youre only remembering the really important things its very efficient forgetting yes so theres a selection of what we remember and i think there are really cool connection to higher level cognition here regarding consciousness deciding and emotions so deciding what comes to consciousness and what gets stored in memory which are not trivial either so youve been at the forefront there all along showing some of the amazing things that neural networks deep neural networks can do in the field of artificial intelligence is just broadly in all kinds of applications but we can talk about that forever but what in your view because were thinking towards the future is the weakest aspect of the way deep neural networks represent the world what is that what is in your view is missing so current state of the art neural nets trained on large quantities of images or texts have some level of understanding of you know what explains those data sets but its very basic its its very low level and its not nearly as robust and abstract and general as our understanding okay so that doesnt tell us how to fix things but i think it encourages us to think about how we can maybe train our neural nets differently so that they would focus for example on causal explanation something that we dont do currently with neural net training also one thing ill talk about in my talk this afternoon is the fact that instead of learning separately from images and videos on one hand and from texts on the other hand we need to do a better job of jointly learning about language and about the world to which it refers so that you know both sides can help each other we need to have good world models in our neural nets for them to really understand sentences which talk about whats going on in the world and i think we need language input to help provide clues about what high level concepts like semantic concepts should be represented at the top levels of our neural nets in fact there is evidence that the purely unsupervised learning of representations doesnt give rise to high level representations that are as powerful as the ones were getting from supervised learning and so the clues were getting just with the labels not even sentences is already very very high level and i think thats a very important thing to keep in mind its already very powerful do you think thats an architecture challenge or is it a data set challenge neither im tempted to just end it there can you elaborate slightly of course data sets and architectures are something you want to always play with but i think the crucial thing is more the training objectives the training frameworks for example going from passive observation of data to more active agents which learn by intervening in the world the relationships between causes and effects the sort of objective functions which could be important to allow the highest level explanations to rise from the learning which i dont think we have now the kinds of objective functions which could be used to reward exploration the right kind of exploration so these kinds of questions are neither in the data set nor in the architecture but more in how we learn under what objectives and so on yeah ive heard you mention in several contexts the idea of sort of the way children learn they interact with objects in the world and it seems fascinating because in some sense except with some cases in reinforcement learning that idea is not part of the learning process in artificial neural networks so its almost like do you envision something like an objective function saying you know what if you poke this object in this kind of way it would be really helpful for me to further learn right right sort of almost guiding some aspect of the learning right right right so i was talking to rebecca sacks just a few minutes ago and she was talking about lots and lots of evidence from infants seem to clearly pick what interests them in a directed way and so theyre not passive learners they focus their attention on aspects of the world which are most interesting surprising in a non trivial way that makes them change their theories of the world so thats a fascinating view of the future progress but on a more maybe boring question do you think going deeper and larger so do you think just increasing the size of the things that have been increasing a lot in the past few years is going to be a big thing i think increasing the size of the things that have been increasing a lot in the past few years will also make significant progress so some of the representational issues that you mentioned theyre kind of shallow in some sense oh shallow in the sense of abstraction in the sense of abstraction theyre not getting some i dont think that having more depth in the network in the sense of instead of 100 layers youre going to have more layers i dont think so is that obvious to you yes what is clear to me is that engineers and companies and labs and grad students will continue to tune architectures and explore all kinds of tweaks to make the current state of the art slightly ever slightly better but i dont think thats going to be nearly enough i think we need changes in the way that were considering learning to achieve the goal that these learners actually understand in a deep way the environment in which they are you know observing and acting but i guess i was trying to ask a question thats more interesting than just more layers its basically once you figure out a way to learn through interacting how many parameters it takes to store that information so i think our brain is quite bigger than most neural networks right right oh i see what you mean oh im with you there so i agree that in order to build neural nets with the kind of broad knowledge of the world that typical adult humans have probably the kind of computing power we have now is going to be insufficient so the good news is there are hardware companies building neural net chips and so its going to get better however the good news in a way which is also a bad news is that even our state of the art deep learning methods fail to learn models that understand even very simple environments like some grid worlds that we have built even these fairly simple environments i mean of course if you train them with enough examples eventually they get it but its just like instead of what humans might need just dozens of examples these things will need millions for very very very simple tasks and so i think theres an opportunity for academics who dont have the kind of computing power that say google has to do really important and exciting research to advance the state of the art in training frameworks learning models agent learning in even simple environments that are synthetic that seem trivial but yet current machine learning fails on we talked about priors and common sense knowledge it seems like we humans take a lot of knowledge for granted so whats your view of these priors of forming this broad view of the world this accumulation of information and how we can teach neural networks or learning systems to pick that knowledge up so knowledge for a while the artificial intelligence was maybe in the 80s like theres a time where knowledge representation knowledge acquisition expert systems i mean the symbolic ai was a view was an interesting problem set to solve and it was kind of put on hold a little bit it seems like because it doesnt work it doesnt work thats right but thats right but the goals of that remain important yes remain important and how do you think those goals can be addressed right so first of all i believe that one reason why the classical expert systems approach failed is because a lot of the knowledge we have so you talked about common sense intuition theres a lot of knowledge like this which is not consciously accessible there are lots of decisions were taking that we cant really explain even if sometimes we make up a story and that knowledge is also necessary for machines to take good decisions and that knowledge is hard to codify in expert systems rule based systems and classical ai formalism and there are other issues of course with the old ai like not really good ways of handling uncertainty i would say something more subtle which we understand better now but i think still isnt enough in the minds of people theres something really powerful that comes from distributed representations the thing that really makes neural nets work so well and its hard to replicate that kind of power in a symbolic world the knowledge in expert systems and so on is nicely decomposed into like a bunch of rules whereas if you think about a neural net its the opposite you have this big blob of parameters which work intensely together to represent everything the network knows and its not sufficiently factorized its not sufficiently factorized and so i think this is one of the weaknesses of current neural nets that we have to take lessons from classical ai in order to bring in another kind of compositionality which is common in language for example and in these rules but that isnt so native to neural nets and on that line of thinking disentangled representations yes so let me connect with disentangled representations if you might if you dont mind so for many years ive thought and i still believe that its really important that we come up with learning algorithms either unsupervised or supervised but reinforcement whatever that build representations in which the important factors hopefully causal factors are nicely separated and easy to pick up from the representation so thats the idea of disentangled representations it says transform the data into a space where everything becomes easy we can maybe just learn with linear models about the things we care about and i still think this is important but i think this is missing out on a very important ingredient which classical ai systems can remind us of so lets say we have these disentangled representations you still need to learn about the relationships between the variables those high level semantic variables theyre not going to be independent i mean this is like too much of an assumption theyre going to have some interesting relationships that allow to predict things in the future to explain what happened in the past the kind of knowledge about those relationships in a classical ai system is encoded in the rules like a rule is just like a little piece of knowledge that says oh i have these two three four variables that are linked in this interesting way then i can say something about one or two of them given a couple of others right in addition to disentangling the elements of the representation which are like the variables in a rule based system you also need to disentangle the mechanisms that relate those variables to each other so like the rules so the rules are neatly separated like each rule is you know living on its own and when i change a rule because im learning it doesnt need to break other rules whereas current neural nets for example are very sensitive to whats called catastrophic forgetting where after ive learned some things and then i learn new things they can destroy the old things that i had learned right if the knowledge was better factorized and separated disentangled then you would avoid a lot of that now you cant do this in the sensory domain what do you mean by sensory domain like in pixel space but my idea is that when you project the data in the right semantic space it becomes possible to now represent this extra knowledge beyond the transformation from inputs to representations which is how representations act on each other and predict the future and so on in a way that can be neatly disentangled so now its the rules that are disentangled from each other and not just the variables that are disentangled from each other and you draw a distinction between semantic space and pixel like does there need to be an architectural difference well yeah so theres the sensory space like pixels which where everything is entangled the information like the variables are completely interdependent in very complicated ways and also computation like its not just the variables its also how they are related to each other is all intertwined but im hypothesizing that in the right high level representation space both the variables and how they relate to each other can be disentangled and that will provide a lot of generalization power generalization power yes distribution of the test set is assumed to be the same as the distribution of the training set right this is where current machine learning is too weak it doesnt tell us anything is not able to tell us anything about how our neural nets say are going to generalize to a new distribution and you know people may think well but theres nothing we can say if we dont know what the new distribution will be the truth is humans are able to generalize to new distributions yeah how are we able to do that yeah because there is something these new distributions even though they could look very different from the training distributions they have things in common so let me give you a concrete example you read a science fiction novel the science fiction novel maybe you know brings you in some other planet where things look very different on the surface but its still the same laws of physics and so you can read the book and you understand whats going on so the distribution is very different but because you can transport a lot of the knowledge you had from earth about the underlying cause and effect relationships and physical mechanisms and all that and maybe even social interactions you can now make sense of what is going on on this planet where like visually for example things are totally different taking that analogy further and distorting it lets enter a science fiction world of say space odyssey 2001 with hal or maybe which is probably one of my favorite ai movies me too and then theres another one that a lot of people love that may be a little bit outside of the ai community is ex machina i dont know if youve seen it yes yes by the way what are your views on that movie are you able to enjoy it are there things i like and things i hate so you could talk about that in the context of a question i want to ask which is theres quite a large community of people from different backgrounds often outside of ai who are concerned about existential threat of artificial intelligence youve seen this community develop over time youve seen you have a perspective so what do you think is the best way to talk about ai safety to think about it to have discourse about it within ai community and outside and grounded in the fact that ex machina is one of the main sources of information for the general public about ai so i think youre putting it right theres a big difference between the sort of discussion we ought to have within the ai community and the sort of discussion that really matter in the general public so i think the picture of terminator and ai loose and killing people and super intelligence thats going to destroy us whatever we try isnt really so useful for the public discussion because for the public discussion the things i believe really matter are the short term and medium term very likely negative impacts of ai on society whether its from security like you know big brother scenarios with face recognition or killer robots or the impact on the job market or concentration of power and discrimination all kinds of social issues which could actually some of them could really threaten democracy for example just to clarify when you said killer robots you mean autonomous weapon weapon systems yes i dont mean thats right so i think these short and medium term concerns should be important parts of the public debate now existential risk for me is a very unlikely consideration but still worth academic investigation in the same way that you could say should we study what could happen if meteorite you know came to earth and destroyed it so i think its very unlikely that this is going to happen in or happen in a reasonable future the sort of scenario of an ai getting loose goes against my understanding of at least current machine learning and current neural nets and so on its not plausible to me but of course i dont have a crystal ball and who knows what ai will be in 50 years from now so i think it is worth that scientists study those problems its just not a pressing question as far as im concerned so before i continue down that line i have a few questions there but what do you like and not like about ex machina as a movie because i actually watched it for the second time and enjoyed it i hated it the first time and i enjoyed it quite a bit more the second time when i sort of learned to accept certain pieces of it see it as a concept movie what was your experience what were your thoughts so the negative is the picture it paints of science is totally wrong science in general and ai in particular science is not happening in some hidden place by some you know really smart guy one person this is totally unrealistic this is not how it happens even a team of people in some isolated place will not make it science moves by small steps thanks to the collaboration and community of a large number of people interacting and all the scientists who are expert in their field kind of know what is going on even in the industrial labs its information flows and leaks and so on and the spirit of it is very different from the way science is painted in this movie yeah let me ask on that point its been the case to this point that kind of even if the research happens inside google or facebook inside companies it still kind of comes out ideas come out do you think that will always be the case with ai is it possible to bottle ideas to the point where theres a set of breakthroughs that go completely undiscovered by the general research community do you think thats even possible its possible but its unlikely its not how it is done now its not how i can foresee it in the foreseeable future but of course i dont have a crystal ball and science is a crystal ball and so who knows this is science fiction after all i think its ominous that the lights went off during that discussion so the problem again theres one thing is the movie and you could imagine all kinds of science fiction the problem for me maybe similar to the question about existential risk is that this kind of movie paints such a wrong picture of what is the actual science and how its going on that it can have unfortunate effects on peoples understanding of current science and so thats kind of sad theres an important principle in research which is diversity so in other words research is exploration research is exploration in the space of ideas and different people will focus on different directions and this is not just good its essential so im totally fine with people exploring directions that are contrary to mine or look orthogonal to mine i am more than fine i think its important i and my friends dont claim we have universal truth about what will especially about what will happen in the future now that being said we have our intuitions and then we act accordingly according to where we think we can be most useful and where society has the most to gain or to lose we should have those debates and not end up in a society where theres only one voice and one way of thinking and research money is spread out so disagreement is a sign of good research good science yes the idea of bias in the human sense of bias how do you think about instilling in machine learning something thats aligned with human values in terms of bias we intuitively as human beings have a concept of what bias means of what fundamental respect for other human beings means but how do we instill that into machine learning systems do you think so i think there are short term things that are already happening and then there are long term things that we need to do in the short term there are techniques that have been proposed and i think will continue to be improved and maybe alternatives will come up to take data sets in which we know there is bias we can measure it pretty much any data set where humans are being observed taking decisions will have some sort of bias discrimination against particular groups and so on and we can use machine learning techniques to try to build predictors classifiers that are going to be less biased we can do it for example using adversarial methods to make our systems less sensitive to these variables we should not be sensitive to so these are clear well defined ways of trying to address the problem maybe they have weaknesses and more research is needed and so on but i think in fact they are sufficiently mature that governments should start regulating companies where it matters say like insurance companies so that they use those techniques because those techniques will probably reduce the bias but at a cost for example maybe their predictions will be less accurate and so companies will not do it until you force them all right so this is short term long term im really interested in thinking how we can instill moral values into computers obviously this is not something well achieve in the next five or 10 years how can we you know theres already work in detecting emotions for example in images in sounds in texts and also studying how different agents interacting in different ways may correspond to patterns of say injustice which could trigger anger so these are things we can do in the medium term and eventually train computers to model for example how humans react emotionally i would say the simplest thing is unfair situations which trigger anger this is one of the most basic emotions that we share with other animals i think its quite feasible within the next few years that we can build systems that can detect these kinds of things to the extent unfortunately that they understand enough about the world around us which is a long time away but maybe we can initially do this in virtual environments so you can imagine a video game where agents interact in some ways and then some situations trigger an emotion i think we could train machines to detect those situations and predict that the particular emotion will likely be felt if a human was playing one of the characters you have shown excitement and done a lot of excellent work with unsupervised learning but theres been a lot of success on the supervised learning side yes yes and one of the things im really passionate about is how humans and robots work together and in the context of supervised learning that means the process of annotation do you think about the problem of annotation put in a more interesting way as humans teaching machines yes is there yes i think its an important subject reducing it to annotation may be useful for somebody building a system tomorrow but longer term the process of teaching i think is something that deserves a lot more attention from the machine learning community so there are people who have coined the term machine teaching so what are good strategies for teaching a learning agent and can we design and train a system that is going to be a good teacher so in my group we have a project called bbi or bbi game where there is a game or scenario where theres a learning agent and a teaching agent presumably the teaching agent would eventually be a human but were not there yet and the role of the teacher is to use its knowledge of the environment which it can acquire using whatever way brute force to help the learner learn as quickly as possible so the learner is going to try to learn by itself maybe using some exploration and whatever but the teacher can choose can have an influence on the interaction with the learner so as to guide the learner maybe teach it the things that the learner has most trouble with or just add the boundary between what it knows and doesnt know and so on so theres a tradition of these kind of ideas from other fields and like tutorial systems for example and ai and of course people in the humanities have been thinking about these questions but i think its time that machine learning people look at this because in the future well have more and more human machine interaction with the human in the loop and i think understanding how to make this work better all the problems around that are very interesting and not sufficiently addressed youve done a lot of work with language too what aspect of the traditionally formulated turing test a test of natural language understanding and generation in your eyes is the most difficult of conversation what in your eyes is the hardest part of conversation to solve for machines so i would say its everything having to do with the non linguistic knowledge which implicitly you need in order to make sense of sentences things like the winograd schema so these sentences that are semantically ambiguous in other words you need to understand enough about the world in order to really interpret properly those sentences i think these are interesting challenges for machine learning because they point in the direction of building systems that both understand how the world works and this causal relationships in the world and associate that knowledge with how to express it in language either for reading or writing you speak french yes its my mother tongue its one of the romance languages do you think passing the turing test and all the underlying challenges we just mentioned depend on language do you think it might be easier in french than it is in english or is independent of language i think its independent of language i would like to build systems that can use the same principles the same learning mechanisms to learn from human agents whatever their language well certainly us humans can talk more beautifully and smoothly in poetry some russian originally i know poetry in russian is maybe easier to convey complex ideas than it is in english but maybe im showing my bias and some people could say that about french but of course the goal ultimately is our human brain is able to utilize any kind of those languages to use them as tools to convey meaning yeah of course there are differences between languages and maybe some are slightly better at some things but in the grand scheme of things where were trying to understand how the brain works and language and so on i think these differences are minute so youve lived perhaps through an ai winter of sorts yes how did you stay warm and continue your research stay warm with friends with friends okay so its important to have friends and what have you learned from the experience listen to your inner voice dont you know be trying to just please the crowds and the fashion and if you have a strong intuition about something that is not contradicted by actual evidence go for it i mean it could be contradicted by people not your own instinct of based on everything youve learned of course you have to adapt your beliefs when your experiments contradict those beliefs but you have to stick to your beliefs otherwise its what allowed me to go through those years its what allowed me to persist in directions that you know took time whatever other people think took time to mature and bring fruits so history of ai is marked with these of course its marked with technical breakthroughs but its also marked with these seminal events that capture the imagination of the community most recent i would say alphago beating the world champion human go player was one of those moments what do you think the next such moment might be okay so first of all i think that these so called seminal events are overrated as i said science really moves by small steps now what happens is you make one more small step and its like the drop that you know that fills the bucket and then you have drastic consequences because now youre able to do something you were not able to do before or now say the cost of building some device or solving a problem becomes cheaper than what existed and you have a new market that opens up right so especially in the world of commerce and applications the impact of a small scientific progress could be huge but in the science itself i think its very very gradual and where are these steps being taken now so theres unsupervised learning so if i look at one trend that i like in my community so for example at milan my institute what are the two hardest topics gans and reinforcement learning even though in montreal in particular reinforcement learning was something pretty much absent just two or three years ago so theres really a big interest from students and theres a big interest from people like me so i would say this is something where were going to see more progress even though it hasnt yet provided much in terms of actual industrial fallout like even though theres alphago theres no like google is not making money on this right now but i think over the long term this is really really important for many reasons so in other words i would say reinforcement learning may be more generally agent learning because it doesnt have to be with rewards it could be in all kinds of ways that an agent is learning about its environment now reinforcement learning youre excited about do you think gans could provide something at the moment well gans or other generative models i believe will be crucial ingredients in building agents that can understand the world a lot of the successes in reinforcement learning in the past has been with policy gradient where you just learn a policy you dont actually learn a model of the world but there are lots of issues with that and we dont know how to do model based rl right now but i think this is where we have to go in order to build models that can generalize faster and better like to new distributions that capture to some extent at least the underlying causal mechanisms in the world last question what made you fall in love with artificial intelligence if you look back what was the first moment in your life when you were fascinated by either the human mind or the artificial mind you know when i was an adolescent i was reading a lot and then i started reading science fiction there you go thats it thats where i got hooked and then you know i had one of the first personal computers and i got hooked in programming and so it just you know start with fiction and then make it a reality thats right yoshua thank you so much for talking to me my pleasure', 'the following is a conversation with vladimir vapnik hes the co inventor of support vector machines support vector clustering vc theory and many foundational ideas in statistical learning he was born in the soviet union and worked at the institute of control sciences in moscow then in the united states he worked at att nec labs facebook research and now is a professor at columbia university his work has been cited over 170000 times he has some very interesting ideas about artificial intelligence and the nature of learning especially on the limits of our current approaches and the open problems in the field this conversation is part of mit course on artificial general intelligence and the artificial intelligence podcast if you enjoy it please subscribe on youtube or rate it on itunes or your podcast provider of choice or simply connect with me on twitter or other social networks at lex friedman spelled f r i d and now heres my conversation with vladimir vapnik einstein famously said that god doesnt play dice yeah you have studied the world through the eyes of statistics so let me ask you in terms of the nature of reality fundamental nature of reality does god play dice we dont know some factors and because we dont know some factors which could be important it looks like god plays dice but we should describe it in philosophy they distinguish between two positions positions of instrumentalism where youre creating theory for prediction and position of realism where youre trying to understand what god did can you describe instrumentalism and realism a little bit for example if you have some mechanical laws what is that is it law which is true always and everywhere or it is law which allow you to predict position of moving element what you believe you believe that it is gods law that god created the world which obey to this physical law or it is just law for predictions and which one is instrumentalism for predictions if you believe that this is law of god and its always true everywhere that means that youre realist so youre trying to really understand gods thought so the way you see the world is as an instrumentalist you know im working for some models model of machine learning so in this model we can see setting and we try to solve resolve the setting to solve the problem and you can do in two different way from the point of view of instrumentalist and thats what everybody does now because they say that goal of machine learning is to find the rule for classification that is true but it is instrument for prediction but i can say the goal of machine learning is to learn about conditional probability so how god played use and if he play what is probability for one what is probability for another given situation but for prediction i dont need this i need the rule but for understanding i need conditional probability so let me just step back a little bit first to talk about you mentioned which i read last night the parts of the 1960 paper by eugene wigner unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics and natural sciences such a beautiful paper by the way made me feel to be honest to confess my own work in the past few years on deep learning heavily applied made me feel that i was missing out on some of the beauty of nature in the way that math can uncover so let me just step away from the poetry of that for a second how do you see the role of math in your life is it a tool is it poetry where does it sit and does math for you have limits of what it can describe some people say that math is language which use god use god so i believe that speak to god or use god or use god use god yeah so i believe that this article about effectiveness unreasonable effectiveness of math is that if youre looking at mathematical structures they know something about reality and the most scientists from natural science theyre looking on equation and trying to understand reality so the same in machine learning if you try very carefully look on all equations which define conditional probability you can understand something about reality more than from your fantasy so math can reveal the simple underlying principles of reality perhaps you know what means simple it is very hard to discover them but then when you discover them and look at them you see how beautiful they are and it is surprising why people did not see that before youre looking on equation and derive it from equations for example i talked yesterday about least square method and people had a lot of fantasy how to improve least square method but if youre going step by step by solving some equations you suddenly will get some term which after thinking you understand that it describes position of observation point in least square method we throw out a lot of information we dont look in composition of point of observations were looking only on residuals but when you understood that thats very simple idea but its not too simple to understand and you can derive this just from equations so some simple algebra a few steps will take you to something surprising that when you think about you understand and that is proof that human intuition is not too rich and very primitive and it does not see very simple situations so let me take a step back in general yes but what about human as opposed to intuition ingenuity moments of brilliance do you have to be so hard on human intuition are there moments of brilliance in human intuition they can leap ahead of math and then the math will catch up i dont think so i think that the best human intuition it is putting in axioms and then it is technical see where the axioms take you but if they correctly take axioms but it axiom polished during generations of scientists and this is integral wisdom that is beautifully put but if you maybe look at when you think of einstein and special relativity what is the role of imagination coming first there in the moment of discovery of an idea so there is obviously a mix of math and out of the box imagination there that i dont know whatever i did i exclude any imagination because whatever i saw in machine learning that comes from imagination like features like deep learning they are not relevant to the problem when you are looking very carefully from mathematical equations you are deriving very simple theory which goes far beyond theoretically than whatever people can imagine because it is not good fantasy it is just interpretation it is just fantasy but it is not what you need you dont need any imagination to derive the main principle of machine learning when you think about learning and intelligence maybe thinking about the human brain and trying to describe mathematically the process of learning that is something like what happens in the human brain do you think we have the tools currently do you think we will ever have the tools to try to describe that process of learning it is not description what is going on it is interpretation it is your interpretation your vision can be wrong you know one guy invented microscope levenhuk for the first time only he got this instrument and he kept secret about microscope but he wrote a report in london academy of science in his report when he was looking at the blood he looked everywhere on the water on the blood on the sperm but he described blood like fight between queen and king so he saw blood cells red cells and he imagined that it is army fighting each other and it was his interpretation of situation and he sent this report in academy of science they very carefully looked because they believed that he is right he saw something yes but he gave wrong interpretation and i believe the same can happen with brain with brain yeah the most important part you know i believe in human language in some proverbs there is so much wisdom for example people say that it is better than thousand days of diligent studies one day with great teacher but if i will ask you what teacher does nobody knows and that is intelligence but we know from history and now from math and machine learning that teacher can do a lot so what from a mathematical point of view is the great teacher i dont know thats an open question no but we can say what teacher can do he can introduce some invariants some predicate for creating invariants how he doing it i dont know because teacher knows reality and can describe from this reality a predicate invariants but he knows that when youre using invariant you can decrease number of observations hundred times so but maybe try to pull that apart a little bit i think you mentioned like a piano teacher saying to the student play like a butterfly yeah i play piano i play guitar for a long time yeah maybe its romantic poetic but it feels like theres a lot of truth in that statement like there is a lot of instruction in that statement and so can you pull that apart what is that the language itself may not contain this information it is not blah blah blah it is not blah blah blah it affects you its what it affects you it affects your playing yes it does but its not the laying it feels like what is the information being exchanged there what is the nature of information what is the representation of that information i believe that it is sort of predicate but i dont know that is exactly what intelligence and machine learning should be yes because the rest is just mathematical technique i think that what was discovered recently is that there is two mechanism of learning one called strong convergence mechanism and weak convergence mechanism before people use only one convergence in weak convergence mechanism you can use predicate thats what play like butterfly and it will immediately affect your playing you know there is english proverb great if it looks like a duck swims like a duck and quack like a duck then it is probably duck yes but this is exact about predicate looks like a duck what it means you saw many ducks that youre training data so you have description of how looks integral looks ducks yeah the visual characteristics of a duck yeah but you want and you have model for recognition so you would like so that theoretical description from model coincide with empirical description which you saw on territory so about looks like a duck it is general but what about swims like a duck you should know that duck swims you can say it play chess like a duck okay duck doesnt play chess and it is completely legal predicate but it is useless so half teacher can recognize not useless predicate so up to now we dont use this predicate in existing machine learning so why we need zillions of data but in this english proverb they use only three predicate looks like a duck swims like a duck and quack like a duck so you cant deny the fact that swims like a duck and quacks like a duck has humor in it has ambiguity lets talk about swim like a duck it doesnt say jump like a duck why because its not relevant but that means that you know ducks you know different birds you know animals and you derive from this that it is relevant to say swim like a duck so underneath in order for us to understand swims like a duck it feels like we need to know millions of other little pieces of information which we pick up along the way you dont think so there doesnt need to be this knowledge base in those statements carries some rich information that helps us understand the essence of duck yeah how far are we from integrating predicates you know that when you consider complete theory of machine learning so what it does you have a lot of functions and then youre talking it looks like a duck you see your training data from training data you recognize like expected duck should look then you remove all functions which does not look like you think it should look from training data so you decrease amount of function from which you pick up one then you give a second predicate and again decrease the set of function and after that you pick up the best function you can find it is standard machine learning so why you need not too many examples because your predicates arent very good that means that predicates are very good because every predicate is invented to decrease admissible set of function so you talk about admissible set of functions and you talk about good functions so what makes a good function so admissible set of function is set of function which has small capacity or small diversity small vc dimension example which contain good function inside so by the way for people who dont know vc youre the v in the vc so how would you describe to lay person what vc theory is how would you describe vc so when you have a machine so machine capable to pick up one function from the admissible set of function but set of admissible function can be big so it contain all continuous functions and its useless you dont have so many examples to pick up function but it can be small small we call it capacity but maybe better called diversity so not very different function in the set its infinite set of function but not very diverse so it is small vc dimension when vc dimension is small you need small amount of training data so the goal is to create admissible set of functions which is have small vc dimension and contain good function then you will be able to pick up the function using small amount of observations so that is the task of learning yeah is creating a set of admissible functions that has a small vc dimension and then youve figure out a clever way of picking up no that is goal of learning which i formulated yesterday statistical learning theory does not involve in creating admissible set of function in classical learning theory everywhere 100 in textbook the set of function admissible set of function is given but this is science about nothing because the most difficult problem to create admissible set of functions given say a lot of functions continuum set of function create admissible set of functions that means that it has finite vc dimension small vc dimension and contain good function so this was out of consideration so whats the process of doing that i mean its fascinating what is the process of creating this admissible set of functions that is invariant thats invariant yeah youre looking of properties of training data and properties means that you have some function and you just count what is value average value of function on training data you have model and what is expectation of this function on the model and they should coincide so the problem is about how to pick up functions it can be any function in fact it is true for all functions but because when were talking say duck does not jumping so you dont ask question jump like a duck because it is trivial it does not jumping and doesnt help you to recognize jump but you know something which question to ask and youre asking it seems like a duck but looks like a duck at this general situation looks like say guy who have this illness this disease it is legal so there is a general type of predicate looks like and special type of predicate which related to this specific problem and that is intelligence part of all this business and that where teacher is involved incorporating the specialized predicates what do you think about deep learning as neural networks these arbitrary architectures as helping accomplish some of the tasks youre thinking about their effectiveness or lack thereof what are the weaknesses and what are the possible strengths you know i think that this is fantasy everything which like deep learning like features let me give you this example one of the greatest books is churchill book about history of second world war and he started this book describing that in old time when war is over so the great kings they gathered together almost all of them were relatives and they discussed what should be done how to create peace and they came to agreement and when happened first world war the general public came in power and they were so greedy that robbed germany and it was clear for everybody that it is not peace that peace will last only 20 years because they were not professionals and the same i see in machine learning there are mathematicians who are looking for the problem from a very deep point of view mathematical point of view and there are computer scientists who mostly does not know mathematics they just have interpretation of that and they invented a lot of blah blah blah interpretations like deep learning why you need deep learning mathematic does not know deep learning mathematic does not know neurons it is just function if you like to say piecewise linear function say that and do in class of piecewise linear function but they invent something and then they try to prove advantage of that through interpretations which mostly wrong and when its not enough they appeal to brain which they know nothing about that nobody knows whats going on in the brain so i think that more reliable work on math this is a mathematical problem do your best to solve this problem try to understand that there is not only one way of convergence which is strong way of convergence there is a weak way of convergence which requires predicate and if you will go through all this stuff you will see that you dont need deep learning even more i would say one of the theory which called represented theory it says that optimal solution of mathematical problem which is described learning is on shadow network not on deep learning and a shallow network yeah the ultimate problem is there absolutely in the end what youre saying is exactly right the question is you have no value for throwing something on the table playing with it not math its like a neural network where you said throwing something in the bucket or the biological example and looking at kings and queens or the cells or the microscope you dont see value in imagining the cells or kings and queens and using that as inspiration and imagination for where the math will eventually lead you you think that interpretation basically deceives you in a way thats not productive i think that if youre trying to analyze this business of learning and especially discussion about deep learning it is discussion about interpretation not about things about what you can say about things thats right but arent you surprised by the beauty of it so not mathematical beauty but the fact that it works at all or are you criticizing that very beauty our human desire to interpret to find our silly interpretations in these constructs let me ask you this are you surprised and does it inspire you how do you feel about the success of a system like alphago at beating the game of go using neural networks to estimate the quality of a board and the quality of the position that is your interpretation quality of the board yeah yes yeah so its not our interpretation the fact is a neural network system it doesnt matter a learning system that we dont i think mathematically understand that well beats the best human player does something that was thought impossible that means that its not a very difficult problem so you empirically weve empirically have discovered that this is not a very difficult problem yeah its true so maybe cant argue so even more i would say that if they use deep learning it is not the most effective way of learning theory and usually when people use deep learning theyre using zillions of training data yeah but you dont need this so i describe challenge can we do some problems which do well deep learning method this deep net using hundred times less training data even more some problems deep learning cannot solve because its not necessary they create admissible set of function to create deep architecture means to create admissible set of functions you cannot say that youre creating good admissible set of functions you just its your fantasy it does not come from us but it is possible to create admissible set of functions because you have your training data that actually for mathematicians when you consider a variant you need to use law of large numbers when youre making training in existing algorithm you need uniform law of large numbers which is much more difficult it requires vc dimension and all this stuff but nevertheless if you use both weak and strong way of convergence you can decrease a lot of training data you could do the three the swims like a duck and quacks like a duck so lets step back and think about human intelligence in general clearly that has evolved in a non mathematical way it wasnt as far as we know god or whoever didnt come up with a model and place in our brain of admissible functions it kind of evolved i dont know maybe you have a view on this so alan turing in the 50s in his paper asked and rejected the question can machines think its not a very useful question but can you briefly entertain this useful useless question can machines think so talk about intelligence and your view of it i dont know that i know that turing described imitation if computer can imitate human being lets call it intelligent and he understands that it is not thinking computer he completely understands what hes doing but he set up problem of imitation so now we understand that the problem is not in imitation im not sure that intelligence is just inside of us it may be also outside of us i have several observations so when i prove some theorem its very difficult theorem in couple of years in several places people prove the same theorem say sawyer lemma after us was done then another guys proved the same theorem in the history of science its happened all the time for example geometry its happened simultaneously first it did lobachevsky and then gauss and boyai and another guys and its approximately in 10 times period 10 years period of time and i saw a lot of examples like that and many mathematicians think that when they develop something they develop something in general which affect everybody so maybe our model that intelligence is only inside of us is incorrect its our interpretation it might be there exists some connection with world intelligence i dont know youre almost like plugging in into yeah exactly and contributing to this into a big network into a big maybe in your own network on the flip side of that maybe you can comment on big o complexity and how you see classifying algorithms by worst case running time in relation to their input so that way of thinking about functions do you think p equals np do you think thats an interesting question yeah it is an interesting question but let me talk about complexity in about worst case scenario there is a mathematical setting when i came to united states in 1990 people did not know they did not know statistical learning theory so in russia it was published to monographs our monographs but in america they didnt know then they learned and somebody told me that it is worst case theory and they will create real case theory but till now it did not because it is mathematical too you can do only what you can do using mathematics and which has a clear understanding and clear description and for this reason we introduce complexity and we need this because using actually it is diversity i like this one more you see the mention you can prove some theorems but we also create theory for case when you know probability measure and that is the best case which can happen it is entropy theory so from mathematical point of view you know the best possible case and the worst possible case you can derive different model in medium but its not so interesting you think the edges are interesting the edges are interesting because it is not so easy to get good bound exact bound its not many cases where you have the bound is not exact but interesting principles which discover the mass do you think its interesting because its challenging and reveals interesting principles that allow you to get those bounds or do you think its interesting because its actually very useful for understanding the essence of a function of an algorithm so its like me judging your life as a human being by the worst thing you did and the best thing you did versus all the stuff in the middle it seems not productive i dont think so because you cannot describe situation in the middle so it will be not general so you can describe edges cases and it is clear it has some model but you cannot describe model for every new case so you will be never accurate when youre using model but from a statistical point of view the way youve studied functions and the nature of learning in the world dont you think that the real world has a very long tail that the edge cases are very far away from the mean the stuff in the middle or no i dont know that i think that from my point of view if you will use formal statistic you need uniform law of large numbers if you will use this invariance business you will need just law of large numbers and theres this huge difference between uniform law of large numbers and large numbers is it useful to describe that a little more or should we just take it to for example when im talking about duck i give three predicates and that was enough but if you will try to do formal distinguish you will need a lot of observations so that means that information about looks like a duck contain a lot of bit of information formal bits of information so we dont know that how much bit of information contain things from artificial and from intelligence and that is the subject of analysis till now all business i dont like how people consider artificial intelligence they consider us some codes which imitate activity of human being it is not science it is applications you would like to imitate go ahead it is very useful and a good problem but you need to learn something more how people try to do how people can to develop say predicates seems like a duck or play like butterfly or something like that not the teacher says you how it came in his mind how he choose this image so that process that is problem of intelligence that is the problem of intelligence and you see that connected to the problem of learning absolutely because you immediately give this predicate like specific predicate seems like a duck or quack like a duck it was chosen somehow so what is the line of work would you say if you were to formulate as a set of open problems that will take us there to play like a butterfly well get a system to be able to lets separate two stories one mathematical story that if you have predicate you can do something and another story how to get predicate it is intelligence problem and people even did not start to understand intelligence because to understand intelligence first of all try to understand what do teachers how teacher teach why one teacher better than another one yeah and so you think we really even havent started on the journey of generating the predicates no we dont understand we even dont understand that this problem exists because did you hear you do no i just know name i want to understand why one teacher better than another and how affect teacher student it is not because he repeating the problem which is in textbook he makes some remarks he makes some philosophy of reasoning yeah thats a beautiful so it is a formulation of a question that is the open problem why is one teacher better than another right what he does better yeah what what why in at every level how do they get better what does it mean to be better the whole yeah yeah from whatever model i have one teacher can give a very good predicate one teacher can say swims like a dog and another can say jump like a dog and jump like a dog carries zero information so what is the most exciting problem in statistical learning youve ever worked on or are working on now i just finished this invariant story and im happy that i believe that it is ultimate learning story at least i can show that there are no another mechanism only two mechanisms but they separate statistical part from intelligent part and i know nothing about intelligent part and if you will know this intelligent part so it will help us a lot in teaching in learning in learning yeah you will know it when we see it so for example in my talk the last slide was a challenge so you have say nist digit recognition problem and deep learning claims that they did it very well say 995 of correct answers but they use 60000 observations can you do the same using hundred times less but incorporating invariants what it means you know digit one two three but looking on that explain to me which invariant i should keep to use hundred examples or say hundred times less examples to do the same job yeah that last slide unfortunately your talk ended quickly but that last slide was a powerful open challenge and a formulation of the essence here what is the exact problem of intelligence because everybody when machine learning started and it was developed by mathematicians they immediately recognized that we use much more training data than humans needed but now again we came to the same story have to decrease that is the problem of learning it is not like in deep learning they use zillions of training data because maybe zillions are not enough if you have a good invariants maybe you will never collect some number of observations but now it is a question to intelligence how to do that because statistical part is ready as soon as you supply us with predicate we can do good job with small amount of observations and the very first challenge is well known digit recognition and you know digits and please tell me invariants i think about that i can say for digit three i would introduce concept of horizontal symmetry so the digit three has horizontal symmetry say more than say digit two or something like that but as soon as i get the idea of horizontal symmetry i can mathematically invent a lot of measure of horizontal symmetry or then vertical symmetry or diagonal symmetry whatever if i have idea of symmetry but what else i think on digit i see that it is meta predicate which is not shape it is something like symmetry like how dark is whole picture something like that which can self rise a predicate you think such a predicate could rise out of something that is not general meaning it feels like for me to be able to understand the difference between two and three i would need to have had a childhood of 10 to 15 years playing with kids going to school being yelled by parents all of that walking jumping looking at ducks and then i would be able to generate the right predicate for telling the difference between two and a three or do you think theres a more efficient way i dont know i know for sure that you must know something more than digits yes and thats a powerful statement yeah but maybe there are several languages of description these elements of digits so im talking about symmetry about some properties of geometry im talking about something abstract i dont know that but this is a problem of intelligence so in one of our articles it is trivial to show that every example can carry not more than one bit of information in real because when you show example and you say this is one you can remove say a function which does not tell you one say is the best strategy if you can do it perfectly its remove half of the functions but when you use one predicate which looks like a duck you can remove much more functions than half and that means that it contains a lot of bit of information from formal point of view but when you have a general picture of what you want to recognize and general picture of the world can you invent this predicate and that predicate carries a lot of information beautifully put maybe just me but in all the math you show in your work which is some of the most profound mathematical work in the field of learning ai and just math in general i hear a lot of poetry and philosophy you really kind of talk about philosophy of science theres a poetry and music to a lot of the work youre doing and the way youre thinking about it so do you where does that come from do you escape to poetry do you escape to music or not i think that there exists ground truth there exists ground truth yeah and that can be seen everywhere the smart guy philosopher sometimes im surprised how they deep see sometimes i see that some of them are completely out of subject but the ground truth i see in music music is the ground truth yeah and in poetry many poets they believe they take dictation so what piece of music as a piece of empirical evidence gave you a sense that they are touching something in the ground truth it is structure the structure of the math of music yeah because when youre listening to bach you see the structure very clear very classic very simple and the same in math when you have axioms in geometry you have the same feeling and in poetry sometimes you see the same and if you look back at your childhood you grew up in russia you maybe were born as a researcher in russia youve developed as a researcher in russia youve came to united states and a few places if you look back what was some of your happiest moments as a researcher some of the most profound moments not in terms of their impact on society but in terms of their impact on how damn good you feel that day and you remember that moment you know every time when you found something it is great in the life every simple things but my general feeling is that most of my time was wrong you should go again and again and again and try to be honest in front of yourself not to make interpretation but try to understand that its related to ground truth it is not my blah blah blah interpretation and something like that but youre allowed to get excited at the possibility of discovery oh yeah you have to double check it no but how its related to another ground truth is it just temporary or it is for forever you know you always have a feeling when you found something how big is that so 20 years ago when we discovered statistical learning theory nobody believed except for one guy dudley from mit and then in 20 years it became fashion and the same with support vector machines that is kernel machines so with support vector machines and learning theory when you were working on it you had a sense you had a sense of the profundity of it how this seems to be right this seems to be powerful right absolutely immediately i recognized that it will last forever and now when i found this invariant story i have a feeling that it is complete learning because i have proof that there are no different mechanisms you can have some cosmetic improvement you can do but in terms of invariants you need both invariants and statistical learning and they should work together but also im happy that we can formulate what is intelligence from that and to separate from technical part and that is completely different absolutely well vladimir thank you so much for talking today thank you its an honor', 'the following is a conversation with guido van rossum creator of python one of the most popular programming languages in the world used in almost any application that involves computers from web back end development to psychology neuroscience computer vision robotics deep learning natural language processing and almost any subfield of ai this conversation is part of mit course on artificial general intelligence and the artificial intelligence podcast if you enjoy it subscribe on youtube itunes or your podcast provider of choice or simply connect with me on twitter at lex friedman spelled f r i d and now heres my conversation with guido van rossum you were born in the netherlands in 1956 your parents and the world around you was deeply deeply impacted by world war two as was my family from the soviet union so with that context what is your view of human nature are some humans inherently good and some inherently evil or do we all have both good and evil within us guido van rossum ouch i did not expect such a deep one i i guess we all have good and evil potential in us and a lot of it depends on circumstances and context peter bell out of that world at least on the soviet union side in europe sort of out of suffering out of challenge out of that kind of set of traumatic events often emerges beautiful art music literature in an interview i read or heard you said you enjoyed dutch literature when you were a child can you tell me about the books that had an influence on you in your childhood guido van rossum well with as a teenager my favorite writer was my favorite dutch author was a guy named willem frederik hermans whos writing certainly his early novels were all about sort of ambiguous things that happened during world war two i think he was a young adult during that time and he wrote about it a lot and very interesting very good books i thought i think peter bell in a nonfiction way guido van rossum no it was all fiction but it was very much set in the ambiguous world of resistance against the germans where often you couldnt tell whether someone was truly in the resistance or really a spy for the germans and some of the characters in his novels sort of crossed that line and you never really find out what exactly happened peter bell and in his novels theres always a good guy and a bad guy the nature of good and evil is it clear theres a hero guido van rossum no his heroes are often more his main characters are often anti heroes and so theyre not very heroic theyre often they fail at some level to accomplish their lofty goals peter bell and looking at the trajectory through the rest of your life has literature dutch or english or translation had an impact outside the technical world that you existed in guido van rossum i still read novels i dont think that it impacts me that much directly peter bell it doesnt impact your work guido van rossum its a separate world my work is highly technical and sort of the world of art and literature doesnt really directly have any bearing on it peter bell you dont think theres a creative element to the design you know some would say design of a language is art guido van rossum im not disagreeing with that im just saying that sort of i dont feel direct influences from more traditional art on my own creativity peter bell right of course you dont feel doesnt mean its not somehow deeply there in your subconscious guido van rossum who knows peter bell who knows so lets go back to your early teens your hobbies were building electronic circuits building mechanical models what if you can just put yourself back in the mind of that young guido 12 13 14 was that grounded in a desire to create a system so to create something or was it more just tinkering just the joy of puzzle solving guido van rossum i think it was more the latter actually i maybe towards the end of my high school period i felt confident enough that that i designed my own circuits that were sort of interesting somewhat but a lot of that time i literally just took a model kit and follow the instructions putting the things together i mean i think the first few years that i built electronics kits i really did not have enough understanding of sort of electronics to really understand what i was doing i mean i could debug it and i could sort of follow the instructions very carefully which has always stayed with me but i had a very naive model of like how do i build a circuit of like how a transistor works and i dont think that in those days i had any understanding of coils and capacitors which actually sort of was a major problem when i started to build more complex digital circuits because i was unaware of the sort of the analog part of the â€“ how they actually work and i would have things that â€“ the schematic looked â€“ everything looked fine and it didnt work and what i didnt realize was that there was some megahertz level oscillation that was throwing the circuit off because i had a sort of â€“ two wires were too close or the switches were kind of poorly built but through that time i think its really interesting and instructive to think about because echoes of it are in this time now so in the 1970s the personal computer was being born so did you sense in tinkering with these circuits did you sense the encroaching revolution in personal computing so if at that point we would sit you down and ask you to predict the 80s and the 90s do you think you would be able to do so successfully to unroll the process thats happening no i had no clue i remember i think in the summer after my senior year â€“ or maybe it was the summer after my junior year â€“ well at some point i think when i was 18 i went on a trip to the math olympiad in eastern europe and there was like â€“ i was part of the dutch team and there were other nerdy kids that sort of had different experiences and one of them told me about this amazing thing called a computer and i had never heard that word my own explorations in electronics were sort of about very simple digital circuits and i had sort of â€“ i had the idea that i somewhat understood how a digital calculator worked and so there is maybe some echoes of computers there but i never made that connection i didnt know that when my parents were paying for magazine subscriptions using punched cards that there was something called a computer that was involved that read those cards and transferred the money between accounts i was also not really interested in those things it was only when i went to university to study math that i found out that they had a computer and students were allowed to use it and there were some â€“ youre supposed to talk to that computer by programming it what did that feel like finding â€“ yeah that was the only thing you could do with it the computer wasnt really connected to the real world the only thing you could do was sort of â€“ you typed your program on a bunch of punched cards you gave the punched cards to the operator and an hour later the operator gave you back your printout and so all you could do was write a program that did something very abstract and i dont even remember what my first forays into programming were but they were sort of doing simple math exercises and just to learn how a programming language worked did you sense okay first year of college you see this computer youre able to have a program and it generates some output did you start seeing the possibility of this or was it a continuation of the tinkering with circuits did you start to imagine that one the personal computer but did you see it as something that is a tool like a word processing tool maybe for gaming or something or did you start to imagine that it could be going to the world of robotics like the frankenstein picture that you could create an artificial being theres like another entity in front of you you did not see the computer i dont think i really saw it that way i was really more interested in the tinkering its maybe not a sort of a complete coincidence that i ended up sort of creating a programming language which is a tool for other programmers ive always been very focused on the sort of activity of programming itself and not so much what happens with the program you write right i do remember and i dont remember maybe in my second or third year probably my second actually someone pointed out to me that there was this thing called conways game of life youre probably familiar with it i think â€“ in the 70s i think is when they came up with it so there was a scientific american column by someone who did a monthly column about mathematical diversions im also blanking out on the guys name it was very famous at the time and i think up to the 90s or so and one of his columns was about conways game of life and he had some illustrations and he wrote down all the rules and sort of there was the suggestion that this was philosophically interesting that that was why conway had called it that and all i had was like the two pages photocopy of that article i dont even remember where i got it but it spoke to me and i remember implementing a version of that game for the batch computer we were using where i had a whole pascal program that sort of read an initial situation from input and read some numbers that said do so many generations and print every so many generations and then out would come pages and pages of sort of things i remember much later ive done a similar thing using python but that original version i wrote at the time i found interesting because i combined it with some trick i had learned during my electronics hobbyist times i essentially first on paper i designed a simple circuit built out of logic gates that took nine bits of input which is sort of the cell and its neighbors and produced a new value for that cell and its like a combination of a half adder and some other clipping its actually a full adder and so i had worked that out and then i translated that into a series of boolean operations on pascal integers where you could use the integers as bitwise values and so i could basically generate 60 bits of a generation in like eight instructions or so nice so i was proud of that its funny that you mentioned so for people who dont know conways game of life its a cellular automata where theres single compute units that kind of look at their neighbors and figure out what they look like in the next generation based on the state of their neighbors and this is deeply distributed system in concept at least and then theres simple rules that all of them follow and somehow out of this simple rule when you step back and look at what occurs its beautiful theres an emergent complexity even though the underlying rules are simple theres an emergent complexity now the funny thing is youve implemented this and the thing youre commenting on is youre proud of a hack you did to make it run efficiently when youre not commenting on its a beautiful implementation youre not commenting on the fact that theres an emergent complexity that youve coded a simple program and when you step back and you print out the following generation after generation thats stuff that you may have not predicted would happen is happening and is that magic i mean thats the magic that all of us feel when we program when you create a program and then you run it and whether its hello world or it shows something on screen if theres a graphical component are you seeing the magic in the mechanism of creating that i think i went back and forth as a student we had an incredibly small budget of computer time that we could use it was actually measured i once got in trouble with one of my professors because i had overspent the departments budget its a different story i actually wanted the efficient implementation because i also wanted to explore what would happen with a larger number of generations and a larger size of the board once the implementation was flawless i would feed it different patterns and then i think maybe there was a follow up article where there were patterns that were like gliders patterns that repeated themselves after a number of generations but translated one or two positions to the right or up or something like that i remember things like glider guns well you can google conways game of life people still go aww and ooh over it for a reason because its not really well understood why i mean this is what stephen wolfram is obsessed about we dont have the mathematical tools to describe the kind of complexity that emerges in these kinds of systems the only way you can do is to run it im not convinced that its sort of a problem that lends itself to classic mathematical analysis one theory of how you create an artificial intelligence or artificial being is you kind of have to same with the game of life you kind of have to create a universe and let it run that creating it from scratch in a design way coding up a python program that creates a fully intelligent system may be quite challenging you might need to create a universe just like the game of life you might have to experiment with a lot of different universes before there is a set of rules that doesnt essentially always just end up repeating itself in a trivial way yeah and stephen wolfram works with these simple rules says that its kind of surprising how quickly you find rules that create interesting things you shouldnt be able to but somehow you do and so maybe our universe is laden with rules that will create interesting things that might not look like humans but emergent phenomena thats interesting may not be as difficult to create as we think sure but let me sort of ask at that time some of the world at least in popular press was kind of captivated perhaps at least in america by the idea of artificial intelligence that these computers would be able to think pretty soon and did that touch you at all in science fiction or in reality in any way i didnt really start reading science fiction until much much later i think as a teenager i read maybe one bundle of science fiction stories was it in the background somewhere like in your thoughts that sort of the using computers to build something intelligent always felt to me because and how did you try to design it into the language there are different tasks and as a programmer its useful to have different tools available that sort of are suitable for different tasks so i still write c code i still write shell code but i write most of my things in python why do i still use those other languages because sometimes the task just demands it and well i would say most of the time the task actually demands a certain language because the task is not write a program that solves problem x from scratch but its more like fix a bug in existing program x or add a small feature to an existing large program but even if youre not constrained in your choice of language by context like that there is still the fact that if you write it in a certain language then you have this balance between how long does it take you to write the code and how long does the code run and when youre in the phase of exploring solutions you often spend much more time writing the code than running it because every time youve run it you see that the output is not quite what you wanted and you spend some more time coding and a language like python just makes that iteration much faster because there are fewer details that you have to get right before your program compiles and runs there are libraries that do all sorts of stuff for you so you can sort of very quickly take a bunch of existing components put them together and get your prototype application running just like when i was building electronics i was using a breadboard most of the time so i had this sprawl out circuit that if you shook it it would stop working because it was not put together very well but it functioned and all i wanted was to see that it worked and then move on to the next schematic or design or add something to it once youve sort of figured out oh this is the perfect design for my radio or light sensor or whatever then you can say okay how do we design a pcb for this how do we solder the components in a small space how do we make it so that it is robust against say voltage fluctuations or mechanical disruption i know nothing about that when it comes to designing electronics but i know a lot about that when it comes to writing code so the initial steps are efficient fast and theres not much stuff that gets in the way but youre kind of describing like darwin described the evolution of species right youre observing of what is true about python now if you take a step back if the act of creating languages is art and you had three months to do it initial steps so you just specified a bunch of goals sort of things that you observe about python perhaps you had those goals but how do you create the rules the syntactic structure the features that result in those so i have in the beginning and i have follow up questions about through the evolution of python too but in the very beginning when you were sitting there creating the lexical analyzer or whatever python was still a big part of it because i sort of i said to myself i dont want to have to design everything from scratch im going to borrow features from other languages that i like oh interesting so you basically exactly you first observe what you like yeah and so thats why if youre 17 years old and you want to sort of create a programming language youre not going to be very successful at it because you have no experience with other languages whereas i was in my lets say mid 30s i had written parsers before so i had worked on the implementation of abc i had spent years debating the design of abc with its authors with its designers i had nothing to do with the design it was designed fully as it ended up being implemented when i joined the team but so you borrow ideas and concepts and very concrete sort of local rules from different languages like the indentation and certain other syntactic features from abc but i chose to borrow string literals and how numbers work from c and various other things so in then if you take that further so yet youve had this funny sounding but i think surprisingly accurate and at least practical title of benevolent dictator for life for quite you know for the last three decades or whatever or no not the actual title but functionally speaking so you had to make decisions design decisions can you maybe lets take python 2 so releasing python 3 as an example its not backward compatible to python 2 in ways that a lot of people know so what was that deliberation discussion decision like yeah what was the psychology of that experience do you regret any aspects of how that experience undergone that well yeah so it was a group process really at that point even though i was bdfl in name and certainly everybody sort of respected my position as the creator and the current sort of owner of the language design i was looking at everyone else for feedback sort of python 30 in some sense was sparked by other people in the community pointing out oh well there are a few issues that sort of bite users over and over can we do something about that and for python 3 we took a number of those python words as they were called at the time and we said can we try to sort of make small changes to the language that address those words and we had sort of in the past we had always taken backwards compatibility very seriously and so many python words in earlier versions had already been resolved because they could be resolved while maintaining backwards compatibility or sort of using a very gradual path of evolution of the language in a certain area and so we were stuck with a number of words that were widely recognized as problems not like roadblocks but nevertheless sort of things that some people trip over and you know that thats always the same thing that people trip over when they trip and we could not think of a backwards compatible way of resolving those issues but its still an option to not resolve the issues right and so yes for a long time we had sort of resigned ourselves to well okay the language is not going to be perfect in this way and that way and that way and we sort of certain of these i mean there are still plenty of things where you can say well that particular detail is better in java or in r or in visual basic or whatever and were okay with that because well we cant easily change it its not too bad we can do a little bit with user education or we can have a static analyzer or warnings in the parse or something but there were things where we thought well these are really problems that are not going away they are getting worse in the future we should do something about that but ultimately there is a decision to be made right so was that the toughest decision in the history of python you had to make as the benevolent dictator for life or if not what are there maybe even on the smaller scale what was the decision where you were really torn up about well the toughest decision was probably to resign all right lets go there hold on a second then let me just because in the interest of time too because i have a few cool questions for you and lets touch a really important one because it was quite dramatic and beautiful in certain kinds of ways in july this year three months ago you wrote now that pep 572 is done i dont ever want to have to fight so hard for a pep and find that so many people despise my decisions i would like to remove myself entirely from the decision process ill still be there for a while as an ordinary core developer and ill still be available to mentor people possibly more available but im basically giving myself a permanent vacation from being bdfl benevolent dictator for life and you all will be on your own first of all its almost shakespearean im not going to appoint a successor so what are you all going to do create a democracy anarchy a dictatorship a federation so that was a very dramatic and beautiful set of statements its almost its open ended nature called the community to create a future for python its just kind of a beautiful aspect to it so what and dramatic you know what was making that decision like what was on your heart on your mind stepping back now a few months later im glad you liked the writing because it was actually written pretty quickly it was literally something like after months and months of going around in circles i had finally approved pep572 which i had a big hand in its design although i didnt initiate it originally i sort of gave it a bunch of nudges in a direction that would be better for the language so sorry just to ask is async io thats the one or no pep572 was actually a small feature which is assignment expressions that had been there was just a lot of debate where a lot of people claimed that they knew what was pythonic and what was not pythonic and they knew that this was going to destroy the language this was like a violation of pythons most fundamental design philosophy and i thought that was all bullshit because i was in favor of it and i would think i know something about pythons design philosophy so i was really tired and also stressed of that thing and literally after sort of announcing i was going to accept it a certain wednesday evening i had finally sent the email its accepted i can just go implement it so i went to bed feeling really relieved thats behind me and i wake up thursday morning 7 am and i think well that was the last one thats going to be such a terrible debate and thats the last time that i let myself be so stressed out about a pep decision i should just resign ive been sort of thinking about retirement for half a decade ive been joking and sort of mentioning retirement sort of telling the community at some point in the future im going to retire dont take that fl part of my title too literally and i thought okay this is it im done i had the day off i wanted to have a good time with my wife we were going to a little beach town nearby and in i think maybe 15 20 minutes i wrote that thing that you just called shakespearean the funny thing is i didnt even realize what a monumental decision it was because five minutes later i read that link to my message back on twitter where people were already discussing on twitter guido resigned as the bdfl and i had posted it on an internal forum that i thought was only read by core developers so i thought i would at least have one day before the news would sort of get out the on your own aspects had also an element of quite it was quite a powerful element of the uncertainty that lies ahead but can you also just briefly talk about for example i play guitar as a hobby for fun and whenever i play people are super positive super friendly theyre like this is awesome this is great but sometimes i enter as an outside observer i enter the programming community and there seems to sometimes be camps on whatever the topic and the two camps the two or plus camps are often pretty harsh at criticizing the opposing camps as an onlooker i may be totally wrong on this but what do you think of this yeah holy wars are sort of a favorite activity in the programming community and what is the psychology behind that is that okay for a healthy community to have is that a productive force ultimately for the evolution of a language well if everybody is patting each other on the back and never telling the truth it would not be a good thing i think there is a middle ground where sort of being nasty to each other is not okay but there is a middle ground where there is healthy ongoing criticism and feedback that is very productive and you mean at every level you see that i mean someone proposes to fix a very small issue in a code base chances are that some reviewer will sort of respond by saying well actually you can do it better the other way when it comes to deciding on the future of the python core developer community we now have i think five or six competing proposals for a constitution so that future do you have a fear of that future do you have a hope for that future im very confident about that future by and large i think that the debate has been very healthy and productive and i actually when i wrote that resignation email i knew that python was in a very good spot and that the python core developer community the group of 50 or 100 people who sort of write or review most of the code that goes into python those people get along very well most of the time a large number of different areas of expertise are represented different levels of experience in the python core dev community different levels of experience completely outside it in software development in general large systems small systems embedded systems so i felt okay resigning because i knew that the community can really take care of itself and out of a grab bag of future feature developments let me ask if you can comment maybe on all very quickly concurrent programming parallel computing async io these are things that people have expressed hope complained about whatever have discussed on reddit async io so the parallelization in general packaging i was totally clueless on this i just used pip to install stuff but apparently theres pipenv poetry theres these dependency packaging systems that manage dependencies and so on theyre emerging and theres a lot of confusion about whats the right thing to use then also functional programming are we going to get more functional programming or not this kind of idea and of course the gil connected to the parallelization i suppose the global interpreter lock problem can you just comment on whichever you want to comment on well lets take the gil and parallelization and async io as one topic im not that hopeful that python will develop into a sort of high concurrency high parallelism language thats sort of the way the language is designed the way most users use the language the way the language is implemented all make that a pretty unlikely future so you think it might not even need to really the way people use it it might not be something that should be of great concern i think async io is a special case because it sort of allows overlapping io and only io and that is a sort of best practice of supporting very high throughput io many connections per second im not worried about that i think async io will evolve there are a couple of competing packages we have some very smart people who are sort of pushing us to make async io better parallel computing i think that python is not the language for that there are ways to work around it but you cant expect to write an algorithm in python and have a compiler automatically parallelize that what you can do is use a package like numpy and there are a bunch of other very powerful packages that sort of use all the cpus available because you tell the package heres the data heres the abstract operation to apply over it go at it and then were back in the c world those packages are themselves implemented usually in c thats where tensorflow and all these packages come in where they parallelize across gpus for example they take care of that for you in terms of packaging can you comment on the future of packaging in python packaging has always been my least favorite topic its a really tough problem because the os and the platform want to own packaging but their packaging solution is not specific to a language if you take linux there are two competing packaging solutions for linux or for unix in general but they all work across all languages several languages like node javascript ruby and python all have their own packaging solutions that only work within the ecosystem of that language what should you use that is a tough problem my own approach is i use the system packaging system to install python and i use the python packaging system then to install third party python packages thats what most people do ten years ago python packaging was really a terrible situation nowadays pip is the future there is a separate ecosystem for numerical and scientific python based on anaconda those two can live together i dont think there is a need for more than that thats packaging well at least for me thats where ive been extremely happy i didnt even know this was an issue until it was brought up in the interest of time let me sort of skip through a million other questions i have so i watched the five and a half hour oral history that youve done with the computer history museum and the nice thing about it it gave this because of the linear progression of the interview it gave this feeling of a life you know a life well lived with interesting things in it sort of a pretty i would say a good spend of this little existence we have on earth so outside of your family looking back what about this journey are you really proud of are there moments that stand out accomplishments ideas is it the creation of python itself that stands out as a thing that you look back and say damn i did pretty good there well i would say that python is definitely the best thing ive ever done and i wouldnt sort of say just the creation of python but the way i sort of raised python like a baby i didnt just conceive a child but i raised a child and now im setting the child free in the world and ive set up the child to sort of be able to take care of himself and im very proud of that and as the announcer of monty pythons flying circus used to say and now for something completely different do you have a favorite monty python moment or a moment in hitchhikers guide or any other literature show or movie that cracks you up when you think about it you can always play me the dead parrot sketch oh thats brilliant thats my favorite as well its pushing up the daisies okay greta thank you so much for talking with me today lex this has been a great conversation i felt i had so much understanding of what actually goes on inside a computer i knew how many bits of memory it had and how difficult it was to program and sort of i didnt believe at all that you could just build something intelligent out of that that would really sort of satisfy my definition of intelligence i think the most influential thing that i read in my early twenties was gÃ¶del escherbach that was about consciousness and that was a big eye opener in some sense in what sense so on your own brain did you at the time or do you now see your own brain as a computer or is there a total separation of the way so yeah youre very pragmatically practically know the limits of memory the limits of this sequential computing or weakly paralyzed computing and you just know what we have now and its hard to see how it creates but its also easy to see it was in the 40s 50s 60s and now at least similarities between the brain and our computers oh yeah i mean i totally believe that brains are computers in some sense i mean the rules they use to play by are pretty different from the rules we can sort of implement in our current hardware but i dont believe in like a separate thing that infuses us with intelligence or consciousness or any of that theres no soul ive been an atheist probably from when i was 10 years old just by thinking a bit about math and the universe and well my parents were atheists now i know that you could be an atheist and still believe that there is something sort of about intelligence or consciousness that cannot possibly emerge from a fixed set of rules i am not in that camp i totally see that sort of given how many millions of years evolution took its time dna is a particular machine that sort of encodes information and an unlimited amount of information in chemical form and has figured out a way to replicate itself i thought that that was maybe its 300 million years ago but i thought it was closer to half a billion years ago that thats sort of originated and it hasnt really changed that the sort of the structure of dna hasnt changed ever since that is like our binary code that we have in hardware i mean the basic programming language hasnt changed but maybe the programming itself obviously it did sort of it happened to be a set of rules that was good enough to sort of develop endless variability and sort of the idea of self replicating molecules competing with each other for resources and one type eventually sort of always taking over that happened before there were any fossils so we dont know how that exactly happened but i believe its clear that that did happen can you comment on consciousness and how you see it because i think well talk about programming quite a bit well talk about you know intelligence connecting to programming fundamentally but consciousness is this whole other thing do you think about it often as a developer of a programming language and as a human those are pretty sort of separate topics sort of my line of work working with programming does not involve anything that goes in the direction of developing intelligence or consciousness but sort of privately as an avid reader of popular science writing i have some thoughts which is mostly that i dont actually believe that consciousness is an all or nothing thing i have a feeling that and i forget what i read that influenced this but i feel that if you look at a cat or a dog or a mouse they have some form of intelligence if you look at a fish it has some form of intelligence and that evolution just took a long time but i feel that the sort of evolution of more and more intelligence that led to sort of the human form of intelligence followed the evolution of the senses especially the visual sense i mean there is an enormous amount of processing thats needed to interpret a scene and humans are still better at that than computers are and i have a feeling that there is a sort of the reason that like mammals in particular developed the levels of consciousness that they have and that eventually sort of going from intelligence to self awareness and consciousness has to do with sort of being a robot that has very highly developed senses has a lot of rich sensory information coming in so thats a really interesting thought that whatever that basic mechanism of dna whatever that basic building blocks of programming if you just add more abilities more high resolution sensors more sensors you just keep stacking those things on top that this basic programming in trying to survive develops very interesting things that start to us humans to appear like intelligence and consciousness as far as robots go i think that the self driving cars have that sort of the greatest opportunity of developing something like that because when i drive myself i dont just pay attention to the rules of the road i also look around and i get clues from that oh this is a shopping district oh heres an old lady crossing the street oh here is someone carrying a pile of mail theres a mailbox i bet you theyre going to cross the street to reach that mailbox and i slow down and i dont even think about that and so there is so much where you turn your observations into an understanding of what other consciousnesses are going to do or what other systems in the world are going to be oh that tree is going to fall i see sort of i see much more of i expect somehow that if anything is going to become unconscious its going to be the self driving car and not the network of a bazillion computers in a google or amazon data center that are all networked together to do whatever they do so in that sense so you actually highlight because thats what i work in thomas vehicles you highlight the big gap between what we currently cant do and what we truly need to be able to do to solve the problem under that formulation then consciousness and intelligence is something that basically a system should have in order to interact with us humans as opposed to some kind of abstract notion of a consciousness consciousness is something that you need to have to be able to empathize to be able to fear understand what the fear of death is all these aspects that are important for interacting with pedestrians you need to be able to do basic computation based on our human desires and thoughts and if you sort of yeah if you look at the dog the dog clearly knows i mean im not the dog owner but i have friends who have dogs the dogs clearly know what the humans around them are going to do or at least they have a model of what those humans are going to do and they learn some dogs know when youre going out and they want to go out with you theyre sad when you leave them alone they cry theyre afraid because they were mistreated when they were younger we dont assign sort of consciousness to dogs or at least not all that much but i also dont think they have none of that so i think its consciousness and intelligence are not all or nothing the spectrum is really interesting but in returning to programming languages and the way we think about building these kinds of things about building intelligence building consciousness building artificial beings so i think one of the exciting ideas came in the 17th century and with leibniz hobbes descartes where theres this feeling that you can convert all thought all reasoning all the thing that we find very special in our brains you can convert all of that into logic so you can formalize it formal reasoning and then once you formalize everything all of knowledge then you can just calculate and thats what were doing with our brains is were calculating so theres this whole idea that this is possible that this we can actually program but they werent aware of the concept of pattern matching in the sense that we are aware of it now they sort of thought they had discovered incredible bits of mathematics like newtons calculus and their sort of idealism their sort of extension of what they could do with logic and math sort of went along those lines and they thought theres like yeah logic theres like a bunch of rules and a bunch of input they didnt realize that how you recognize a face is not just a bunch of rules but is a shit ton of data plus a circuit that sort of interprets the visual clues and the context and everything else and somehow can massively parallel pattern match against stored rules i mean if i see you tomorrow here in front of the dropbox office i might recognize you even if im wearing a different shirt yeah but if i see you tomorrow in a coffee shop in belmont i might have no idea that it was you or on the beach or whatever i make those kind of mistakes myself all the time i see someone that i only know as like oh this person is a colleague of my wifes and then i see them at the movies and i didnt recognize them but do you see those you call it pattern matching do you see that rules is unable to encode that everything you see all the pieces of information you look around this room im wearing a black shirt i have a certain height im a human all these theres probably tens of thousands of facts you pick up moment by moment about this scene you take them for granted and you aggregate them together to understand the scene you dont think all of that could be encoded to where at the end of the day you can just put it all on the table and calculate i dont know what that means i mean yes in the sense that there is no actual magic there but there are enough layers of abstraction from the facts as they enter my eyes and my ears to the understanding of the scene that i dont think that ai has really covered enough of that distance its like if you take a human body and you realize its built out of atoms well that is a uselessly reductionist view right the body is built out of organs the organs are built out of cells the cells are built out of proteins the proteins are built out of amino acids the amino acids are built out of atoms and then you get to quantum mechanics so thats a very pragmatic view i mean obviously as an engineer i agree with that kind of view but you also have to consider the sam harris view of well intelligence is just information processing like you said you take in sensory information you do some stuff with it and you come up with actions that are intelligent that makes it sound so easy i dont know who sam harris is oh well its a philosopher so like this is how philosophers often think right and essentially thats what descartes was is wait a minute if there is like you said no magic so he basically says it doesnt appear like theres any magic but we know so little about it that it might as well be magic so just because we know that were made of atoms just because we know were made of organs the fact that we know very little how to get from the atoms to organs in a way thats recreatable means that you shouldnt get too excited just yet about the fact that you figured out that were made of atoms right and the same about taking facts as our sensory organs take them in and turning that into reasons and actions that sort of there are a lot of abstractions that we havent quite figured out how to deal with those i mean sometimes i dont know if i can go on a tangent or not so if i take a simple program that parses say i have a compiler that parses a program in a sense the input routine of that compiler of that parser is a sensing organ and it builds up a mighty complicated internal representation of the program it just saw it doesnt just have a linear sequence of bytes representing the text of the program anymore it has an abstract syntax tree and i dont know how many of your viewers or listeners are familiar with compiler technology but theresâ€¦ fewer and fewer these days right thats also true probably people want to take a shortcut but theres sort of this abstraction is a data structure that the compiler then uses to produce outputs that is relevant like a translation of that program to machine code that can be executed by hardware and then that data structure gets thrown away when a fish or a fly sees sort of gets visual impulses im sure it also builds up some data structure and for the fly that may be very minimal a fly may have only a few i mean in the case of a flys brain i could imagine that there are few enough layers of abstraction that its not much more than when its darker here than it is here well it can sense motion because a fly sort of responds when you move your arm towards it so clearly its visual processing is intelligent well not intelligent but it has an abstraction for motion and we still have similar things in but much more complicated in our brains i mean otherwise you couldnt drive a car if you couldnt if you didnt have an incredibly good abstraction for motion yeah in some sense the same abstraction for motion is probably one of the primary sources of our of information for us we just know what to do i think we know what to do with that weve built up other abstractions on top we build much more complicated data structures based on that and we build more persistent data structures sort of after some processing some information sort of gets stored in our memory pretty much permanently and is available on recall i mean there are some things that you sort of youre conscious that youre remembering it like you give me your phone number i well at my age i have to write it down but i could imagine i could remember those seven numbers or ten digits and reproduce them in a while if i sort of repeat them to myself a few times so thats a fairly conscious form of memorization on the other hand how do i recognize your face i have no idea my brain has a whole bunch of specialized hardware that knows how to recognize faces i dont know how much of that is sort of coded in our dna and how much of that is trained over and over between the ages of zero and three but somehow our brains know how to do lots of things like that that are useful in our interactions with other humans without really being conscious of how its done anymore right so our actual day to day lives were operating at the very highest level of abstraction were just not even conscious of all the little details underlying it theres compilers on top of its like turtles on top of turtles or turtles all the way down theres compilers all the way down but thats essentially you say that theres no magic thats what i what i was trying to get at i think is with descartes started this whole train of saying that theres no magic i mean theres all this beforehand well didnt descartes also have the notion though that the soul and the body were fundamentally separate separate yeah i think he had to write in god in there for political reasons so i dont know actually im not a historian but theres notions in there that all of reasoning all of human thought can be formalized i think that continued in the 20th century with russell and with gadots incompleteness theorem this debate of what are the limits of the things that could be formalized thats where the turing machine came along and this exciting idea i mean underlying a lot of computing that you can do quite a lot with a computer you can encode a lot of the stuff were talking about in terms of recognizing faces and so on theoretically in an algorithm that can then run on a computer and in that context id like to ask programming in a philosophical way what does it mean to program a computer so you said you write a python program or compiled a c program that compiles to some byte code its forming layers youre programming a layer of abstraction thats higher how do you see programming in that context can it keep getting higher and higher levels of abstraction i think at some point the higher levels of abstraction will not be called programming and they will not resemble what we call programming at the moment there will not be source code i mean there will still be source code sort of at a lower level of the machine just like there are still molecules and electrons and sort of proteins in our brains but and so theres still programming and system administration and who knows what to keep the machine running but what the machine does is a different level of abstraction in a sense and as far as i understand the way that for the last decade or more people have made progress with things like facial recognition or the self driving cars is all by endless endless amounts of training data where at least as a lay person and i feel myself totally as a lay person in that field it looks like the researchers who publish the results dont necessarily know exactly how their algorithms work and i often get upset when i sort of read a sort of a fluff piece about facebook in the newspaper or social networks and they say well algorithms and thats like a totally different interpretation of the word algorithm because for me the way i was trained or what i learned when i was eight or ten years old an algorithm is a set of rules that you completely understand that can be mathematically analyzed and you can prove things you can like prove that aristotelian sieve produces all prime numbers and only prime numbers yeah so i dont know if you know who andrej karpathy is im afraid not so hes a head of ai at tesla now but he was at stanford before and he has this cheeky way of calling this concept software 20 so let me disentangle that for a second so kind of what youre referring to is the traditional the algorithm the concept of an algorithm something thats there its clear you can read it you understand it you can prove its functioning as kind of software 10 and what software 20 is is exactly what you described which is you have neural networks which is a type of machine learning that you feed a bunch of data and that neural network learns to do a function all you specify is the inputs and the outputs you want and you cant look inside you cant analyze it all you can do is train this function to map the inputs to the outputs by giving a lot of data and thats as programming becomes getting a lot of data thats what programming is well that would be programming 20 to programming 20 i wouldnt call that programming its just a different activity just like building organs out of cells is not called chemistry well so lets just step back and think sort of more generally of course but you know its like as a parent teaching your kids things can be called programming in that same sense thats how programming is being used youre providing them data examples use cases so imagine writing a function not by not with for loops and clearly readable text but more saying well heres a lot of examples of what this function should take and heres a lot of examples of when it takes those functions it should do this and then figure out the rest so thats the 20 concept and so the question i have for you is like its a very fuzzy way this is the reality of a lot of these pattern recognition systems and so on its a fuzzy way of quote unquote programming what do you think about this kind of world should it be called something totally different than programming if youre a software engineer does that mean youre designing systems that are very can be systematically tested evaluated they have a very specific specification and then this other fuzzy software 20 world machine learning world thats something else totally or is there some intermixing thats possible well the question is probably only being asked because we dont quite know what that software 20 actually is and i think there is a truism that every task that ai has tackled in the past at some point we realized how it was done and then it was no longer considered part of artificial intelligence because it was no longer necessary to use that term it was just oh now we know how to do this and a new field of science or engineering has been developed and i dont know if sort of every form of learning or sort of controlling computer systems should always be called programming so i dont know maybe im focused too much on the terminology but i expect that there just will be different concepts where people with sort of different education and a different model of what theyre trying to do will develop those concepts i guess if you could comment on another way to put this concept is i think the kind of functions that neural networks provide is things as opposed to being able to upfront prove that this should work for all cases you throw at it all youre able its the worst case analysis versus average case analysis all youre able to say is it seems on everything weve tested to work 999 of the time but we cant guarantee it and it fails in unexpected ways we cant even give you examples of how it fails in unexpected ways but its like really good most of the time is there no room for that in current ways we think about programming programming 10 is actually sort of getting to that point too where the sort of the ideal of a bug free program has been abandoned long ago by most software developers we only care about bugs that manifest themselves often enough to be annoying and were willing to take the occasional crash or outage or incorrect result for granted because we cant possibly we dont have enough programmers to make all the code bug free and it would be an incredibly tedious business and if you try to throw formal methods at it it becomes even more tedious so every once in a while the user clicks on a link and somehow they get an error and the average user doesnt panic they just click again and see if it works better the second time which often magically it does or they go up and they try some other way of performing their tasks so thats sort of an end to end recovery mechanism and inside systems there is all sorts of retries and timeouts and fallbacks and i imagine that that sort of biological systems are even more full of that because otherwise they wouldnt survive do you think programming should be taught and thought of as exactly what you just said i come from this kind of youre always denying that fact always in sort of basic programming education the sort of the programs youre having students write are so small and simple that if there is a bug you can always find it and fix it because the sort of programming as its being taught in some even elementary middle schools in high school introduction to programming classes in college typically its programming in the small very few classes sort of actually teach software engineering building large systems every summer here at dropbox we have a large number of interns every tech company on the west coast has the same thing these interns are always amazed because this is the first time in their life that they see what goes on in a really large software development environment everything theyve learned in college was almost always about a much smaller scale and somehow that difference in scale makes a qualitative difference in how you do things and how you think about it if you then take a few steps back into decades 70s and 80s when you were first thinking about python or just that world of programming languages did you ever think that there would be systems as large as underlying google facebook and dropbox did you when you were thinking about python i was actually always caught by surprise by sort of this yeah pretty much every stage of computing so maybe just because youve spoken in other interviews but i think the evolution of programming languages are fascinating and its especially because it leads from my perspective towards greater and greater degrees of intelligence i learned the first programming language i played with in russia was with the turtle logo logo yeah and if you look i just have a list of programming languages all of which ive now played with a little bit i mean theyre all beautiful in different ways from fortran cobalt lisp algol 60 basic logo again c as a few the object oriented came along in the 60s simula pascal smalltalk all of that leads theyre all the classics the classics yeah the classic hits right steam thats built on top of lisp on the database side sql c and all of that leads up to python pascal too and thats before python matlab these kind of different communities different languages so can you talk about that world i know that sort of python came out of abc which i actually never knew that language i just having researched this conversation went back to abc and it looks remarkably it has a lot of annoying qualities but underneath those like all caps and so on but underneath that theres elements of python that are quite theyre already there thats where i got all the good stuff all the good stuff so but in that world youre swimming these programming languages were you focused on just the good stuff in your specific circle or did you have a sense of what is everyone chasing you said that every programming language is built to scratch an itch were you aware of all the itches in the community and if not or if yes i mean what itch were you trying to scratch with python well im glad i wasnt aware of all the itches because i would probably not have been able to do anything i mean if youre trying to solve every problem at once youll solve nothing well yeah its too overwhelming and so i had a very very focused problem i wanted a programming language that sat somewhere in between shell scripting and c and now arguably there is like one is higher level one is lower level and python is sort of a language of an intermediate level although its still pretty much at the high level end i was thinking about much more about i want a tool that i can use to be more productive as a programmer in a very specific environment and i also had given myself a time budget for the development of the tool and that was sort of about three months for both the design like thinking through what are all the features of the language syntactically and semantically and how do i implement the whole pipeline from parsing the source code to executing it so i think both with the timeline and the goals it seems like productivity was at the core of it as a goal so like for me in the 90s and the first decade of the 21st century i was always doing machine learning ai programming for my research was always in c and then the other people who are a little more mechanical engineering electrical engineering are matlabby theyre a little bit more matlab focused those are the world and maybe a little bit java too but people who are more interested in emphasizing the object oriented nature of things so within the last 10 years or so especially with the oncoming of neural networks and these packages that are built on python to interface with neural networks i switched to python and its just ive noticed a significant boost that i cant exactly because i dont think about it but i cant exactly put into words why im just much much more productive just being able to get the job done much much faster so how do you think whatever that qualitative difference is i dont know if its quantitative it could be just a feeling i dont know if im actually more productive but how do you think about you probably are yeah well thats right i think theres elements let me just speak to one aspect that i think that was affecting my productivity is c was i really enjoyed creating performant code and creating a beautiful structure where everything that you know this kind of going into this especially with the newer and newer standards of templated programming of just really creating this beautiful formal structure that i found myself spending most of my time doing that as opposed to getting it parsing a file and extracting a few keywords or whatever the task was trying to do so what is it about python how do you think of productivity in general as you were designing it now sort of through the decades last three decades what do you think it means to be a productive programmer', 'the following is a conversation with jeff atwood he is the cofounder of stack overflow and stack exchange websites that are visited by millions of people every single day much like with wikipedia it is difficult to understate the impact on global knowledge and productivity that these networks of sites have created jeff is also the author of the famed blog coding horror and the founder of discourse an open source software project that seeks to improve the quality of our online community discussions this conversation is part of the mit course on artificial general intelligence and the artificial intelligence podcast if you enjoy it subscribe on youtube itunes or your podcast provider of choice or simply connect with me on twitter at lex friedman spelled f r i d and now heres my conversation with jeff atwood having co created and managed for a few years the worlds largest community of programmers in stack overflow 10 years ago what do you think motivates most programmers is it fame fortune glory process of programming itself or is it the sense of belonging to a community its puzzles really i think its this idea of working on puzzles independently of other people and just solving a problem sort of like on your own almost although nobody really works alone in programming anymore but i will say theres an aspect of hiding yourself away and just beating on a problem until you solve it like brute force basically to me is what a lot of programming is the computers so fast that you can do things that would take forever for a human but you can just do them so many times and so often that you get the answer youre saying just the pure act of tinkering with the code is the thing that drives most problems the struggle balance within the joy of overcoming the brute force process of pain and suffering that eventually leads to something that actually works well datas fun too theres this thing called the shuffling problem the naive shuffle that most programmers write has a huge flaw and theres a lot of articles online about this because it can be really bad if youre a casino and you have an unsophisticated programmer writing your shuffle algorithm theres surprising ways to get this wrong but the neat thing is the way to figure that out is just to run your shuffle a bunch of times and see how many orientations of cards you get you should get an equal distribution of all the cards and with the naive method of shuffling if you just look at the data if you just brute force it and say ok i dont know whats going to happen you just write a program that does it a billion times and then see what the buckets look like of the data and the monty hall problem is another example of that where you have three doors and somebody gives you information about another door so the correct answer is you should always switch in the monty hall problem which is not intuitive and it freaks people out all the time but you can solve it with data if you write a program that does the monty hall game and then never switches then always switches just compare you would immediately see that you dont have to be smart you dont have to figure out the answer algorithmically you can just brute force it out with data and say well i know the answer is this because i ran the program a billion times and these are the data buckets that i got from it so empirically find it but whats the joy of that so for you for you personally outside of family what motivates you in this process well to be honest i dont really write a lot of code anymore what i do at discourse is managery stuff which i always despised as a programmer you think of managers as people who dont really do anything themselves but the weird thing about code is you realize that language is code the ability to direct other people lets you get more stuff done than you could by yourself anyway you said language is code language is code meaning communication with other humans yes it is you can think of it as a systematic so what is it like to be what makes before we get into programming what makes a good manager what makes a good leader well i think a leader its all about leading by example first of all sort of doing and being the things that you want to be now this can be kind of exhausting particularly when you have kids because you realize that your kids are watching you all the time even in ways that youve stopped seeing yourself the hardest person to see on the planet is really yourself its a lot easier to see other people and make judgments about them but yourself youre super biased you dont actually see yourself the way other people see you often youre very very hard on yourself in a way that other people really arent going to be so thats one of the insights is youve got to be really diligent about thinking am i behaving in a way that represents how i want other people to behave like leading through example theres a lot of examples of leaders that really mess this up like they make decisions that are like wow its a bad example for other people so i think leading by example is one the other one i believe is working really hard and i dont mean working exhaustively but showing a real passion for the problem not necessarily your solution to the problem but the problem itself is just one that you really believe in like with discourse for example the problem that were looking at which is my current project is how do you get people in groups to communicate in a way that doesnt break down into the howling of wolves how do you deal with trolling not like technical problems how do i get people to post paragraphs how do i get people to use bold how do i get people to use complete sentences although those are problems as well but how do i get people to get along with each other and then solve whatever problem it is they set out to solve or reach some consensus on discussion or just not hurt each other even maybe its a discussion that doesnt really matter but are people yelling at each other and why like thats not the purpose of this kind of communication so i would say leadership is about setting an example doing the things that represent what you want to be and making sure that youre actually doing those things and theres a trick to that too because the things you dont do also say a lot about what you are yeah so lets pause on that one so those two things are fascinating so how do you have as a leader that self awareness so you just said its really hard to be self aware so for you personally or maybe for other leaders youve seen or look up to how do you know both that the things youre doing are the wrong things to be doing the way you speak to others the way you behave and the things youre not doing how do you get that signal i think theres two aspects to that one is like processing feedback that youre getting so how do you get feedback well right so are you getting feedback right so one way we do it for example with discourse we have three cofounders and we periodically talk about decisions before we make them so its not like one person can make a mistake or like wow there can be misunderstandings things like that so its part of like group consensus of leadership is like its good to have i think systems where theres one leader and that leader has the rule of absolute law are just really dangerous in my experience for communities for example like if you have a community thats run by one person that one person makes all the decisions that persons gonna have a bad day something could happen to that person something theres a lot of variables so like first when you think about leadership have multiple people doing leadership and have them talk amongst each other so giving each other feedback about the decisions that theyre making and then when you do get feedback i think theres that little voice in your head right or your gut or wherever you wanna put it in your body i think that voice is really important like i think most people who have any kind of moral compass or like want to do most people want to do the right thing i do believe that i mean there might be a handful of sociopaths out there that dont but most people they want other people to think of them as a good person and why wouldnt you right like do you want people to despise you i mean thats just weird right so you have that little voice that sort of the angel and devil on your shoulder sort of talking to you about like what youre doing how youre doing how does it make you feel to make these decisions right and i think having some attunement to that voice is important but you said that voice also for i think this is a programmer situation too where sometimes the devil on the shoulder is a little too loud so youre a little too self critical for a lot of developers and especially when you have introverted personality how do you struggle with a self criticism or the criticism of others so one of the things of leadership is to do something thats potentially unpopular or where people doubt you and you still go through with the decision so whats that balance like i think you have to walk people through your decision making right like you have to this is where blogging is really important and communication is so important again code language is just another kind of code its like here is the program by which i arrived at the conclusion that im gonna reach right its one thing to say like this is a decision its final deal with it right thats not usually satisfying to people but if you say look weve been thinking about this problem for a while heres some stuff thats happened heres what we think is right heres our goals heres what we wanna achieve and weve looked at these options and we think this available options is the best option people will be like oh okay right maybe i dont totally agree with you but i can kind of see where youre coming from and i see its not just arbitrary decision delivered from a cloud of flames in the sky right its like a human trying to reach some kind of consensus about goals and their goals might be different than yours thats completely legit right but if youre making that clear its like oh well the reason we dont agree is because we have totally different goals right like how could we agree its not that youre a bad person its that we have radically different goals in mind when we started looking at this problem and the other one you said is passion so or hard work sorry well those are tied together in my mind lets say hard work and passion like for me like i just really love the problem discourse is setting out to solve because in a way its like theres a vision of the world where it all devolves into facebook basically owning everything and every aspect of human communication right and this has always been kind of a scary world for me first cause i dont i think facebook is really good at execution i got to compliment them theyre very competent in terms of what theyre doing but facebook has not much of a moral compass in terms of facebook cares about facebook really they dont really care about you and your problems what they care about is how big they can make facebook right is that you talking about the company or just the mechanism of how facebook works kind of both really right like and the idea with discourse the reason im so passionate about it is cause i believe every community should have the right to own themselves right like they should have their own software that they can run that belongs to them thats their space where they can set the rules and if they dont like it they can move to different hosting or you know whatever they need to happen can happen but like this idea of a company town where all human communication is implicitly owned by whatsapp instagram and facebook and its really disturbing too cause facebook is really smart like i said theyre great at execution buying in whatsapp and buying instagram were incredibly smart decisions and they also do this thing i dont know if you know but they have this vpn software that they give away for free on smartphones and it indirectly feeds all the data about the traffic back to facebook so they can see whats actually getting popular through the vpns right they have low level access to the network data because users have let them have that so so lets take a small pause here first of all discourse can you talk about can you lay out the land of all the different ways you can have communities so theres stack overflow that youve built theres discourse so stack overflow is kind of like a wiki wikipedia you talk about and its a very specific scalpel very focused so what is the purpose of discourse and maybe contrast that with facebook first of all say what is discourse yeah start from the beginning well let me start from the very beginning so stack overflow is a very structured wiki style q and a for programmers right and that was the problem we first worked on and when we started we thought it was discussions because we looked at like programming forums and other things but we quickly realized we were doing q and a which is a very narrow subset of human communication right sorry so when you started stack overflow you thought you didnt even know the q and a not really you didnt know it would be q and a well we didnt know we had an idea of like okay these are things that we see working online we had a goal right our goal was there was this site experts exchange with a very unfortunate name thank you for killing that site yeah i know right like a lot of people dont remember it anymore which is great like thats the measure of success when people dont remember the thing that you were trying to replace then youve totally won so it was a place to get answers to programming questions but it wasnt clear if it was like focused q and a if it was a discussion there were plenty of programming forums so we werent really sure we were like okay well take aspects of dig and reddit like voting were very important reordering answers based on votes wiki style stuff of like being able to edit posts not just your posts but other peoples posts to make them better and keep them more up to date ownership of blogging of like okay this is me im saying this in my voice this is the stuff that i know and your reputation accrues to you and its peer recognition so you asked earlier like what motivates programmers i think peer recognition motivates them a lot that was one of the key insights of stack overflow was like recognition from your peers is why things get done not necessarily money not necessarily your boss but like your peers saying wow this person really knows their stuff has a lot of value so the reputation system came from that so we were sort of frankensteining a bunch of stuff together in stack overflow like stuff we had seen working and we knew worked and that became stack overflow over time we realized it wasnt really discussion it was very focused questions and answers there wasnt a lot of room on the page for let me talk about this tangential thing it was more like okay is it answering the question is it clarifying the question or could it be an alternative answer to the same question because theres usually more than one way to do it in programming theres like say five to 10 ways and one of the patterns we got into early on with stack overflow was there were questions where there would be like hundreds of answers and were like wow how can there be a programming question with 500 200 500 answers and we looked at those and we realized those were not really questions in the traditional sense they were discussions it was stuff that we allowed early on that we eventually decided wasnt allowed such as whats your favorite programming food whats the funniest programming cartoon youve seen and we had to sort of backfill a bunch of rules about like why isnt this allowed such as is this a real problem youre facing like nobody goes to work and says wow i cant work cause i dont know what the funniest programming cartoon is so sorry cant compile this code now right its not a real problem youre facing in your job so that was run rule and the second like what can you really learn from that its like what i call accidental learning or reddit style learning where youre just like oh ill just browse some things and oh wow you know did you know tree frogs only live three years i mean i just made that up i dont know if thats true but i didnt really set out to learn that i dont need to know that right its accidental learning it was more intentional learning where youre like okay i have a problem and i want to learn about stuff around this problem having right and it could be theory it could be compiler theory it could be other stuff but im having a compiler problem hence i need to know the compiler theory that aspect of it that gets me to my answer right so kind of a directed learning so we had to backfill all these rules as we sort of figured out what the heck it was we were doing and the system came very strict over time and a lot of people still complain about that and i wrote my latest blog entry what does stack overflow want to be when it grows up celebrating the 10 year anniversary yeah yeah so 10 years and the system has trended towards strictness theres a variety of reasons for this one is people dont like to see other people get reputation for stuff as they view as frivolous which i can actually understand because if you saw a programmer got like 500 upvotes for funniest programming cartoon or funniest comment they had seen in code its like well why do they have that reputation is it because they wrote the joke probably not i mean if they did maybe or the cartoon right theyre getting a bunch of reputation based on someone elses work thats not even programming its just a joke right its related to programming so you begin to resent that youre like well thats not fair and it isnt at some level theyre correct i mean i empathize because its not correct to get reputation for that versus heres a really gnarly regular expression problem and heres a really clever insightful detailed answer laying out oh heres why youre seeing the behavior that youre seeing here let me teach you some things about how to avoid that in the future thats great thats gold right you want people to get reputation for that not so much for wow look at this funny thing i saw right great so theres this very specific qa format and then take me through the journey towards discourse and facebook and twitter so you started at the beginning that stack overflow evolved to have a purpose so what is discourse this passion you have for creating community for discussion when was that born and how well part of it is based on the realization that stack overflow is only good for very specific subjects where its based on data facts and science where answers can be kind of verified to be true another form of that is theres the book of knowledge like the tome of knowledge that defines whatever it is you can refer to that book and itll give you the answer there has to be it only works on subjects where theres like semi clear answers to things that can be verified in some form now again theres always more than one way to do it theres complete flexibility and system around that but where it falls down is stuff like poker and lego like we had if you go to stackexchangecom we have an engine that tries to launch different qa topics right and people can propose qa topics sample questions and if it gets enough support within the network we launched that qa site so some of the ones we launched were poker and lego and they did horribly right because i mean they might still be there lingering on in some form but it was an experiment this is like a test right and some subjects work super well on the stack engine and some dont but the reason lego and poker dont work is because theyre so social really its not about whats the rule here in poker its like well what kind of cigars do we like to smoke while playing poker or whats a cool set of cards to use when im playing poker or whats some strategies say i have this hand come up with some strategies i could use its more of a discussion around whats happening with lego same thing heres this cool lego set i found look how awesome this is and im like yeah thats freaking awesome right its not a question right theres all these social components and discussions that dont fit at all we literally have to disallow those in stack overflow because its not about being social its about problems that youre facing in your work that you need concrete answers for you have a real demonstrated problem thats blocking you in something nobodys blocked by what should i do when i have a straight flush its not a blocking problem in the world its just an opportunity to hang out and discuss so discourse was a way to address that and say look discussion forum software was very very bad and when i came out of stack overflow in early 2012 it was still very very bad i expected it improved in the four years since i last looked but it had not improved at all and i was like well thats kind of terrible because i love these communities of people talking about things that they love theyre just communities of interest right and theres no good software for them startups would come to me and say hey jeff i want to have this startup heres my idea and the first thing i would say to them is well first why are you asking me i dont really know your field necessarily why arent you asking the community the people that are interested in this problem the people that are using your product why arent you talking to them and then theyd say oh great idea how do i do that and then thats when i started playing sad trombone because i realized all the software involving talking to your users customers audience patrons whatever it is it was all really bad it was stuff that i would be embarrassed to recommend to other people and yet thats where i felt they could get the biggest and strongest most effective input for what they should be doing with their product right its from their users from their community right thats what we did on stack overflow so what were talking about with forums the what is it the dark matter of the internet its still i dont know if its still but for the longest time it has some of the most passionate and fascinating discussions and whats the usual structure theres usually its linear so its sequential so youre posting one after the other and theres pagination so its every theres 10 posts and then you go to the next page and that format still is used by like im were doing a lot of research with tesla vehicles and theres a tesla motors club forum which is extremely we really wanted to run that actually they pinged us about it i dont think we got it but i really would have liked to gotten that one but theyve started before even 2012 i believe its like you dont want a heartbeat thats like so fast its like youre just freaking out but it is a measure of health you should have a healthy heartbeat its up to people listening to decide what that means but it has to be healthy it has to be reasonable because otherwise youre just going to be frustrated because thats how you build software you make mistakes you roll it out you live with it you see what it feels like and say oh god that was a terrible idea oh my gosh this could be even better if we did y right you turn the crank and then the more you do that the faster you get ahead of your competitors ultimately its rate of change right delta v right how fast are you moving well within a year youre going to be miles away by the time they catch up with you right thats the way it works and plus as a software developer and user i love software thats constantly changing because i dont understand people who get super pissed off when like oh they changed the software on me how dare they im like yes change the software change it all the time man thats what makes this stuff great is that it can be changed so rapidly and become something that is greater than it is now now granted there are some changes that suck i admit ive seen it many times but in general thats what makes software cool right its that it is so malleable fighting that is weird to me because its like well youre fighting the essence of the thing that youre building that doesnt make sense you want to really embrace that not to be a hummingbird but embrace it to a healthy cycle of your heartbeat right so you talk about that people really dont change its true thats why probably a lot of the stuff you write about in your blog probably will remain true well theres a flip side of the coin people dont change like investing and understanding people is like learning unix in 1970 because nothing has changed right all those things youve learned about people will still be valid 34 years from now whereas if you learn the latest javascript framework thats going to be good for like two years right exactly but if you look at the future of programming so theres a people component but theres also the technology itself what do you see as the future of programming will it change significantly or as far as you can tell people are ultimately programming and so its not something that you foresee changing in any fundamental way well youve got to go look back on sort of the basics of programming and one of things that always shocked me is like source control like i didnt learn anything about source control granted i graduated from college in 1992 but i remember hearing from people as late as like 1998 1999 like even maybe today theyre not learning source control and to me its like well how can you not learn source control that is so fundamental to working with other programmers working in a way that you dont lose your work just basic software the literal bedrock of software development is source control now you compare it today like github right like microsoft bought github which i think was an incredibly smart acquisition move on their part now they have anybody who wants reasonable source control to go sign up on github its all set up for you right theres tons of walkthroughs tons of tutorials so from the concept of like has programming advanced from say 1999 its like well hell we have github i mean my god yes right like its massively advanced over what it was now as to whether programming is significantly different im going to say no but i think the baseline of what we view as fundamentals will continue to go up and actually get better like source control thats one of the fundamentals that has gotten hundreds of orders of magnitude better than it was 10 20 years ago so those are the fundamentals let me introduce two things that maybe you can comment on so one is mobile phones so that could fundamentally transform what programming is or maybe not maybe you can comment on that and the other one is artificial intelligence which promises to in some ways to do some of the programming for you is one way to think about it so its really what a programmer is is using the intelligence thats inside your skull to do something useful the hope with artificial intelligence is that it does some of the useful parts for you where you dont have to think about it so do you see smartphones the fact that everybody has one and theyre getting more and more powerful as potentially changing programming and do you see ai as potentially changing programming ok so thats good so smartphones have definitely changed i mean since i guess 2010 is when they really started getting super popular i mean in the last eight years the world has literally changed right everybody carries a computer around and thats normal i mean that is such a huge change in society i think were still dealing with a lot of the positive and negative ramifications of that right everybodys connected all the time everybodys on the computer all the time that was my dream world as a geek right but its like be careful what you ask for right like wow now everybody has a computer its not quite the utopia that we thought it would be right computers can be used for a lot of stuff thats not necessarily great so to me thats the central focus of the smartphone is just that it puts a computer in front of everyone granted a small touch screen smallish touch screen computer but as for programming i dont know i dont think that ive kind of over time come to subscribe to the unix view of the world when it comes to programming you want to teach these basic command line things and that is just what programming is going to be for i think a long long time i dont think theres any magical visual programming thats going to happen i dont know ive over time have become a believer in that unix philosophy of just you know they kind of had to write with unix thats going to be the way it is for a long long time and well continue to like i said raise the baseline the tools will get better itll get simpler but its still fundamentally going to be command line tools fancy ides thats kind of it for the foreseeable future im not seeing any visual programming stuff on the horizon because you kind of think like what do you do on a smartphone that will be directly analogous to programming like im trying to think right and theres really not much so not necessarily analogous to programming but the kind of things that the kind of programs you would need to write might need to be very different yeah and the kind of languages i mean but i probably also subscribe to the same just because everything in this world might be written in javascript oh yeah thats already happening i mean discourse is a bet discourse itself javascript is another bet on that side of the table and i still try and believe in that so i would say smartphones have mostly a cultural shift more than a programming shift now your other question was about artificial intelligence and sort of devices predicting what youre going to do and i do think theres some strength to that i think artificial intelligence is kind of overselling it in terms of what its doing its more like people are predictable right people do the same things let me give you an example one check we put in a discourse thats been a lot of big commercial websites is say you log in from new york city now and then an hour later you log in from san francisco its like well hmm thats interesting how did you get from new york to san francisco in one hour so at that point youre like ok this is a suspicious login at that point so we would alert you its like ok but thats not ai right thats just a heuristic of like how did you in one hour get 2000 miles right that doesnt i mean youre grand maybe youre on a vpn theres other ways to happen thats just a basic prediction based on the idea that people pretty much dont move around that much they may travel occasionally but nobody unless youre a traveling salesman thats literally traveling the world every day theres so much repetition and predictability in terms of things youre going to do and i think good software anticipates your needs for example google i think its called google now or whatever that google thing is that predicts your commute and predicts based on your phone location where are you every day well thats probably where you work that kind of stuff i do think computers can get a lot better at that i hesitate to call it full blown ai its just computers getting better at like first of all they have a ton of data because everybody has a smartphone now all of a sudden we have all this data that we didnt have before about location about communication and feeding that into some basic heuristics and maybe some fancy algorithms that turn it into predictions of anticipating your needs like a friend would right like oh hey i see your home would you like some dinner right like lets go get some food because thats usually what we do at this time of day right in the context of actually the act of programming do you see ides improving and making the life of programming as better i do think that is possible because theres a lot of repetition in programming right oh you know clippy would be the bad example of oh i see it looks like youre writing a for loop but there are patterns in code right and actually libraries are kind of like that right rather than go code up your own http request library its like well youd use one of the existing ones that we have thats already a troubleshot right its not ai per se its just building better lego bricks bigger lego bricks that have more functionality in them so people dont have to worry about the low level stuff as much anymore like wordpress for example to me is like a tool for somebody who isnt a programmer to do something i mean you can turn wordpress into anything its kind of crazy actually through plugins right and thats not programming per se its just lego bricks stacking wordpress elements right and a little bit of configuration glue so i would say maybe in a broader sense what im seeing like therell be more gluing and less actual programming and thats a good thing right because most of the stuff you need is kind of out there already you said 1970s unix do you see php and these kind of old remnants of the early birth of programming remaining with us for a long time like you said unix in itself do you see ultimately this stuff just being there out of momentum i kind of do i mean i was a big believer in windows early on and i was a big you know i was like unix what a waste of time but over time ive completely flipped on that where i was like okay the unix guys were right and pretty much microsoft and windows were kind of wrong at least on the server side now on the desktop right you need a gui you need all that stuff and you have the two philosophies like apple built on unix effectively darwin and on the desktop its a slightly different story but on the server side where youre gonna be programming now its a question of where the programmings gonna be theres gonna be a lot more like client side programming because technically discourse is client side programming the way you get discourse we deliver a big ball of javascript which is then executed locally so were really using a lot more local computing power well still retrieve the data obviously we have to display the posts on the screen and so forth but in terms of like sorting and a lot of the basic stuff were using the host processor but to the extent that a lot of programming is still gonna be server side i would say yeah the unix philosophy definitely won and therell be different veneers over unix but its still if you peel away one or two layers its gonna be unixy for a long i think unix won i mean so definitively its interesting to hear you say that because youve done so much excellent work on the microsoft side in terms of backend development cool so whats the future hold for jeff atwood i mean the discourse continuing the discourse in trying to improve conversation on the web well discourse is what ive viewed as a and originally i called it a five year project then really quickly revised that to a 10 year project so we started in early 2013 thats when we launched the first version so were still five years in this is the part where it starts getting good like we have a good product now discourse theres any project you build in software it takes three years to build what you want it to build anyway like v1 is gonna be terrible which it was but you ship it anyway because thats how you get better at stuff its about turning the crank its not about v1 being perfect because thats ridiculous its about v1 then lets get really good at v11 12 13 like how fast can we iterate and i think were iterating like crazy on discourse to the point that like its a really good product now we have serious momentum and my original vision was i wanna be the wordpress of discussion meaning someone came to you and said i wanna start a blog although the very question is kind of archaic now its like who actually blogs anymore but i wanted the answer to that to be it would be wordpress normally because thats the obvious choice for blogging most of the time but if someone said hey i need a group of people to get together and do something the answer should be discourse right that should be the default answer for people because its open source its free doesnt cost you anything you control it you can run it your minimum server cost for discourse is five bucks a month at this point they actually got the vps prices down it used to be 10 a month for one gigabyte of ram which we have a kind of heavy stack like theres a lot of stuff in discourse you need postgres you need redis you need ruby and rails you need a sidekick for scheduling its not a trivial amount of stuff because we were architected for like look were building for the next 10 years i dont care about shared php hosting thats not my model my idea is like hey eventually this is gonna be very cheap for everybody and i wanna build it right using again higher bigger building block levels right that have more requirements and theres a wordpress model of wordpressorg wordpresscom is there a central hosting for discourse or no there is were not strictly segmenting into the open source versus the commercial side we have a hosting business thats how discourse makes money is we host discourse instances and we have really close relationship with our customers of the symbiosis of them giving us feedback on the product we definitely wait feedback from customers a lot heavier than feedback from somebody who just wanders by and gives feedback but thats where we make all our money but we dont have a strict division we encourage people to use discourse like the whole point is that its free right anybody can set it up i dont wanna be the only person that hosts discourse thats absolutely not the goal but it is a primary way for us to build a business and its actually kind of a great business i mean the business is going really really well in terms of hosting so i used to work at google research its a company thats basically funded on advertisements so its facebook let me ask if you can comment on it i think advertisement is best so youd be extremely critical on what ads are but at its best its actually serving you in a sense its giving you its connecting you to what you would want to explore so its like related posts or related content its the same thats the best of advertisement so discourse is connecting people based on their interests it seems like a place where advertisement at its best could actually serve the users is that something that youre considering thinking about as a way to bring to financially support the platform thats interesting because i actually have a contrarian view of advertising which i kind of agree with you i recently installed adblocker reluctantly because i dont like to do that but the performance of the ads man theyre so heavy now and its just crazy so its almost like a performance argument more than like i actually am pro ads and i have a contrarian viewpoint i agree with you if you do ads right its serving you stuff you would be interested in anyway i dont mind that that actually is kind of a good thing so plus i think its rational to wanna support the people that are doing this work through seeing their ads but that said i run adblock now which i didnt wanna do but i was convinced by all these articles like 30 40 megabytes of stuff just to serve you ads yeah it feels like ads now are like the experts exchange of whenever you start a stock overflow its a little bit its overwhelming oh theres so many companies in ad tech that its embarrassing like you can do that have you seen those logo charts of like just the whole page its like you cant even see them theyre so small theres so many companies in the space but since you brought it up i do wanna point out that very very few discourse sites actually run using an ad supported model its not effective like its too diluted its too weird it doesnt pay well and like users hate it so its a combination of like users hate it it doesnt actually work that well in practice like in theory yes i agree with you if you had clean fast ads that were exactly the stuff you would be interested in awesome were so far from that though right like and google does an okay job they do retargeting and stuff like that but in the real world discourse sites rarely can make ads work it just doesnt work for so many reasons but you know what does work is subscriptions patreon affiliate codes for like amazon of like just oh heres a cool yo yo click and then you click and go to amazon they get a small percentage of that which is fair i think i mean because you saw the yo yo on that site and you clicked through and you bought it right thats fair for them to get 5 of that or 2 of that whatever it is those things definitely work in fact a site that i used to participate on a lot i helped the owner one of the things i got them to switch to discourse i basically paid them to switch to discourse because i was like look you guys got to switch i cant come here anymore on this terrible software but i was like look and on top of that like youre serving people ads that they hate like you should just go full on patreon because he had a little bit of patreon go full on patreon do the amazon affiliates thing for any amazon links that get posted and just do that and just triple down on that stuff and thats worked really well for them and this creator in particular so that stuff works but traditional ads i mean definitely not working at least on discourse so last question youve created the code keyboard ive programmed most of my adult life on a kinesis keyboard i have one upstairs now can you describe what a mechanical keyboard is and why is it something that makes you happy well you know this is another fetish item really like its not required you can do programming on any kind of keyboard even like an onscreen keyboard oh god thats terrifying but you could i mean if you look back at the early days of computing there were chiclet keyboards which are awful but whats a chiclet keyboard oh god ok well its just like thin rubber membranes oh the rubber ones oh no super bad right so its a fetish item all that really says is look i care really about keyboards because the keyboard is the primary method of communication with the computer so its just like having a nice mic for this podcast you want a nice keyboard right because it has a very tactile feel i can tell exactly when i press the key i get that little click so oh and it feels good and its also kind of a fetish item its like wow i care enough about programming that i care about the tool the primary tool that i use to communicate with the computer make sure its as good as it feels good to use for me and i can be very productive with it so to be honest its a little bit of a fetish item but a good one it indicates that youre serious it indicates youre interested it indicates that you care about the fundamentals because you know what makes you a good programmer being able to type really fast right this is true right so a core skill is just being able to type fast enough to get your ideas out of your head into the code base so just practicing your typing can make you a better programmer it is also something that makes you well makes you enjoy typing correct the actual act something about the process like i play piano its tactile theres a tactile feel that ultimately feeds the passion makes you happy right no totally thats it i mean and its funny because artisanal keyboards have exploded like massdrop has gone ballistic with this stuff theres probably like 500 keyboard projects on massdrop alone and theres some other guy i follow on twitter i used to write for the site the tech report way back in the day and hes like every week hes just posting what i call keyboard porn of just cool keyboards like oh my god those look really cool right its like how many keyboards does this guy have right its kind of like me with yo yos how many yo yos do you have how many do you need well technically one but i like a lot i dont know why so same thing with keyboards so yeah theyre awesome like i highly recommend anybody that doesnt have a mechanical to research it look into it and see what you like and its ultimately a fetish item but i think these sort of items these religious artifacts that we have are part of what make us human like that parts important right its kind of what makes life worth living yeah its not necessary in the strictest sense but aint nothing necessary if you think about it right like so yeah why not so sure jeff thank you so much for talking today yeah youre welcome thanks for having me i mean theyve been running for a long time its still an extremely rich source of information so whats broken about that system and how are you trying to fix it i think theres a lot of power in connecting people that love the same stuff around that specific topic meaning facebooks idea of connection is just any human thats related to another human right like through friendship or any other reason facebooks idea of the world is sort of the status update right like a friend of yours did something ate at a restaurant right whereas discussion forums were traditionally around the interest graph like i love electric cars specifically i love tesla right like i love the way they approach the problem i love the style of the founder i just love the design ethic and theres a lot to like about tesla i dont know if you saw the oatmeal he did a whole love comic to tesla and it was actually kind of cool because i learned some stuff he was talking about how great tesla cars were specifically like how they were built differently and he went into a lot of great detail that was really interesting and to me that oatmeal post if you read it is the genesis of pretty much all interest communities i just really love this stuff so like for me for example theres yo yos right like im into the yo yo communities and these interest communities are just really fascinating to me and i feel more connected to the yo yo communities than i do to friends that i dont see that often right like to me the powerful thing is the interest graph and facebook kind of dabbles in the interest graph i mean they have groups you can sign up for groups and stuff but its really about the relationship graph like this is my coworker this is my relative this is my friend but not so much about the interest so i think thats the linchpin of which forums and communities are built on that i personally love like i said leadership is about passion right and being passionate about stuff is a really valid way to look at the world and i think its a way a lot of stuff in the world gets done like i once had someone describe me as hes like jeff youre a guy who you just get super passionate about a few things at a time and you just go super deep in those things and i was like oh thats kind of right thats kind of what i do i get into something and just be super into that for a couple of years or whatever and just learn all i can about it and go super deep in it and thats how i enjoy experiencing the world right like not being shallow on a bunch of things but being really deep on a few things that im interested in so forums kind of unlock that right and you dont want a world where everything belongs to facebook at least i dont i want a world where communities can kind of own themselves set their own norms set their own rules control the experience because community is also about ownership right like if youre meeting at the barnes and noble every thursday and barnes and noble says get out of here you guys dont buy enough books well you know youre kind of hosed right barnes and noble owns you right like you cant but if you have your own meeting space you know your own clubhouse you can set your own rules decide what you want to talk about there and just really generate a lot better information than you could like hanging out at barnes and noble every thursday at 3 pm right so thats kind of the vision of discourse is a place where its fully open source you can take the software you can install it anywhere and you know you and a group of people can go deep on whatever it is that youre into and this works for startups right startups are a group of people who go super deep on a specific problem right and they want to talk to the community its like well install discourse right thats what we do at discourse thats what i did at stack overflow i spent a lot of time on meta stack overflow which is our internal well public community feedback site and just experiencing what the users were experiencing right because theyre the ones doing all the work in the system and they had a lot of interesting feedback and theres that 90 10 rule of like 90 of the feedback you get is not really actionable for a variety of reasons it might be bad feedback it might be crazy feedback it might be feedback you just cant act on right now but theres 10 of it thats like gold its like literally gold and diamonds where its like feedback of really good improvements to your core product that are not super hard to get to and actually make a lot of sense and my favorite is about 5 of those stuff i didnt even see coming its like oh my god i never even thought of that but thats a brilliant idea right and i can point to so many features of stack overflow that we derive from meta stack overflow feedback and meta discourse right same exact principle of discourse you know were getting ideas from the community i was like oh my god i never thought of that but thats fantastic right like i love that relationship with the community from having built these communities what have you learned about whats the process of getting a critical mass of members in a community is it luck skill timing persistence what is is it the tools like discourse that empower that community whats the key aspect of starting for one guy or gal and then building it to two and then 10 and a hundred and a thousand and so on i think when youre starting with an n of one i mean i think its persistence and also you have to be interesting like somebody i really admire once said something that i always liked about blogging hes like heres how you blog you have to have something interesting to say and have an interesting way of saying it right and then do that for like 10 years so thats the genesis is like you have to have sort of something interesting to say thats not exactly what everybody else is saying and an interesting way of saying it which is another way of saying kind of entertaining way of saying it and then as far as growing it its like ritual you know like you have to like say youre starting a blog you have to say look im gonna blog every week three times a week and you have to stick to that schedule right because until you do that for like several years youre never gonna get anywhere like it just takes years to get to where you need to get to and part of that is having the discipline to stick with the schedule and it helps again if its something youre passionate about this wont feel like work youre like i love this i could talk about this all day every day right you just have to do it in a way thats interesting to other people and then as youre growing the community that pattern of participation within the community of like generating these artifacts and inviting other people to help you like collaborate on these artifacts like even in the case of blogging like i felt in the early days of my blog which i started in 2004 which is really the genesis of stack overflow if you look at all my blog it leads up to stack overflow which was i have all this energy in my blog but i dont like 40000 people were subscribing to me and i was like i wanna do something and then i met joel and said hey joel i wanna do something take this ball of energy from my blog and do something and all the people reading my blog saw that its like oh cool youre involving us youre saying look youre part of this community lets build this thing together like they pick the name like we voted on the name for stack overflow on my blog like we came up and naming is super hard first of all the hardest problem in computer science is coming up with a good name for stuff right but you can go back to my blog theres the poll where we voted and stack overflow became the name of the site and all the early beta users of stack overflow were audience of my blog plus joels blog right so we started from like if you look at the genesis okay i was just a programmer who said hey i love programming but i have no outlet to talk about it so im just gonna blog about it because i dont have enough people to work to talk to about it because at the time i worked a place where you know programming wasnt the core output of the company it was a pharmaceutical company and i just love this stuff you know to an absurd degree so i was like ill just blog about it and then ill find an audience and eventually found an audience eventually found joel and eventually built stack overflow from that one core of activity right but it was that repetition of feeding back in feedback from my blog comments feedback from joel feedback from the early stack overflow community when people see that youre doing that they will follow along with you right theyll say cool youre here in good faith youre actually you know not listening to everything because thats impossible thats impossible but youre actually you know waiting our feedback and what youre doing and why wouldnt i because who does all the work on stack overflow me joel no its the other programmers that are doing all the work so you gotta have some respect for that and then you know discipline around look you know were trying to do a very specific thing here on stack overflow were not trying to solve all the worlds problems were trying to solve this very specific q and a problem in a very specific way not cause were jerks about it but because these strict set of rules help us get really good results right and programmers thats an easy sell for the most part because programmers are used to dealing with ridiculous systems of rules like constantly thats basically their job so theyre very oh yeah super strict system of rules that lets me get what i want thats programming right thats what stack overflow is so so youre making it sound easy but in 2004 lets go back there in 2004 you started the blog coding horror was it called that at the very beginning it was one of the smart things i did its from a book by steve mcconnell code complete which is one of my favorite programming books still probably my number one programming book for anyone to read so one of the smart things i did back then i dont always do smart things when i start stuff i contacted steve and said hey i really like this it was a sidebar illustration indicating danger in code right coding horror was like watch out and i love that illustration because it spoke to me because i saw that illustration go oh my god thats me like im always my own worst enemy like thats the key insight in programming is every time you write something think how am i gonna screw myself because you will constantly right so that icon was like oh yeah i need to constantly hold that mirror up and look and say look youre very fallible youre gonna screw this up like how can you build this in such a way that youre not gonna screw it up later like how can you get that discipline around making sure at every step im thinking through all the things that i could do wrong or that other people could do wrong because that is actually how you get to be a better programmer a lot of times right so that sidebar illustration i loved it so much and i wrote steve before i started my blog and said hey can i have permission to use this because i just really like this illustration and steve was kind enough to give me permission to do that and just continues to give me permission so yeah really thats awesome but in 2004 you started this blog you know you look at stephen king his book on writing or stephen pressfield war of art book i mean it seems like writers suffer i mean its a hard process of writing right theres gonna be suffering i mean i wont kid you well the work is suffering right like doing the work like even when youre every week youre like okay that blog post wasnt very good or people didnt like it or people said disparaging things about it you have to like have the attitude like you know no matter what happens i wanna do this for me right its not about you its about me i mean in the end it is about everyone because this is how good work gets out into the world but you have to be pretty strict about saying like you know im selfish in the sense that i have to do this for me you know you mentioned stephen king like his book on writing but like one of the things i do for example when writing is like i read it out loud one of the best pieces of advice for writing anything is read it out loud like multiple times and make it sound like youre talking because that is the goal of good writing it should sound like you said it with slightly better phrasing because you have more time to think about what youre saying but like it should sound natural when you say it and i think thats probably the single best writing advice i can give anyone just read it over and over out loud make sure it sounds like something you would normally say and it sounds good and whats your process of writing see theres usually a pretty good idea behind the blog post so ideas right so i think you gotta have the concept that theres so many interesting things in the world like i mean my god the world is amazing right like you can never write about everything thats going on because its so incredible but if you cant come up with like lets say one interesting thing per day to talk about then youre not trying hard enough because the world is full of just super interesting stuff and one great way to like mine stuff is go back to old books cause they bring up old stuff thats still super relevant and i did that a lot cause i was like reading classic programming books and a lot of the early blog posts were like oh i was reading this programming book and they brought this really cool concept and i wanna talk about it some more and you get the i mean youre not claiming credit for the idea but it gives you something interesting to talk about thats kind of evergreen right like you dont have to go what should i talk about so well just go dig up some old classic programming books and find something that oh wow thats interesting or how does that apply today or what about x and y or compare these two concepts so pull a couple of sentences from that book and then sort of play off of it almost agree or disagree so in 2007 you wrote that you were offered a significant amount of money to sell the blog you chose not to what were all the elements you were thinking about cause id like to take you back it seems like theres a lot of nonlinear decisions you made through life so what was that decision like right so one of the things i love is the choose your own adventure books which i loved as a kid and i feel like theyre early programmer books cause theyre all about if then statements right if this then this and theyre also very very unforgiving like theres all these sites that map the classic choose your own adventure books and how many outcomes are bad a lot of bad outcomes so part of the game is like oh i got a bad outcome go back one step go back one further step its like how did i get here right like its a sequence of decisions and this is true of life right like every decision is a sequence right individually any individual decision is not necessarily right or wrong but they lead you down a path right so i do think theres some truth to that so this particular decision the blog had gotten fairly popular theres a lot of rss readers that i had discovered and this guy contacted me out of the blue from this like bug tracking company hes like oh i really wanna buy your blog for like i think it was around it was 100000 it might have been like 80000 but it was a lot right like and thats you know at the time like i would have a years worth of salary all at once so i didnt really think about like well you know and i remember talking to people at the time i was like wow thats a lot of money but then im like i really like my blog right like do i wanna sell my blog cause it wouldnt really belong to me anymore at that point and one of the guidelines that i like to i dont like to give advice to people a lot but one of the pieces of advice i do give cause i do think its really true and its generally helpful is whenever youre looking at a set of decisions like oh gosh should i do a b or c you gotta pick the thing thats a little scarier in that list because not you know not like jump off a cliff scary but the thing that makes you nervous cause if you pick the safe choice its usually youre not really pushing youre not pushing yourself youre not choosing the thing thats gonna help you grow so for me the scarier choice was to say no i was like well no lets just see where this is going right because then i own it i mean it belongs to me its my thing and i can just take it and tell some other logical conclusion right because imagine how different the world would have been had i said yes and sold the blog its like there probably wouldnt be stack overflow you know a lot of other stuff would have changed so for that particular decision i think it was that same rule like what scares me a little bit more do the thing that scares you yeah so speaking of which startups i think theres a specific some more general questions that a lot of people would be interested in youve started stack overflow you started this course so whats the it was one two three guys whatever it is in the beginning what was that process like do you start talking about it do you start programming do you start like wheres the birth and the catalyst that actually well i can talk about it in the context of both stack overflow and discourse so i think the key thing initially is there is a problem something theres some state of the world thats unsatisfactory to the point that like youre upset about it right like in that case it was experts exchange i mean joels original idea because i approached joel as like look joel i have all this energy behind my blog i want to do something i want to build something but i dont know what it is because im honestly not a good idea person im really not im like the execution guy im really good at execution but im not good at like blue skying ideas not my forte which is another reason why i like the community feedback because they blue sky all day long for you right so when i can just go in and cherry pick a blue sky idea from community even if i have to spend three hours reading to get one good idea its worth it man but anyway so the idea from joel was hey experts exchange its got great data but the experience is hideous right its trying to trick you it feels like used car salesman its just bad so i was like oh thats awesome it feeds into community it feeds into like you know we can make creative comments so i think the core is to have a really good idea that you feel very strongly about in the beginning that like theres a wrong in the world an injustice that we will write through the process of building this thing for discourse it was like look theres no good software for communities to just hang out and like do stuff right like whether its problem solving startup whatever forums are such a great building block of online community and theyre hideous they were so bad right it was embarrassing like i literally was embarrassed to be associated with this software right i was like we have to have software that you can be proud of its like this is competitive with reddit this is competitive with twitter this is competitive with facebook right i would be proud to have the software on my site so that was the genesis of discourse was feeling very strongly about there needs to be a good solution for communities so thats step one genesis of an idea you feel super strongly about right and then people galvanize around the idea like joel was already super excited about the idea i was excited about the idea so with the forum software i was posting on twitter i had researched as part of my research i start researching the problem right and i found a game called forum wars which was a parody of forum its still very very funny of forum behavior circa i would say 2003 its aged some right like the behaviors a little different in there of twitter but it was awesome it was very funny and it was like a game it was like an rpg and it had a forum attached to it so it was like a game about forums with a forum attached i was like this is awesome right this is so cool and the founder of that company or that project it wasnt really a company contacted me this guy robin ward from toronto he said hey i saw youve been talking about forums and i really love that problem space he was like id still love to build really good forum software because i dont think anything out theres any good and i was like awesome at that point i was like were starting a company because i couldnt have whooshed for a better person to walk through the door and say im excited about this too same thing with joel right i mean joel is a legend in the industry right so when he walked through and said im excited about this problem i was like me too man we can do this right so that to me is the most important step its like having an idea youre super excited about and another person a cofounder right because again you get that dual leadership right am i making a bad decision sometimes its nice to have checks of like is this a good idea i dont know right so those are the crucial seeds but then starting to build stuff whether its you programming or somebody elses there is prototyping so theres tons of research theres tons of research like whats out there that failed because a lot of people look at the successes oh look at how successful x is everybody looks at the successes those are boring show me the failures because that is whats interesting thats where people were experimenting thats where people were pushing and they failed but they probably failed for reasons that werent directly about the quality of their idea right so look at all the failures dont just look what everybody looks at which is like oh gosh look at all these successful people look at the failures look at the things that didnt work research the entire field and so thats the research that i was doing that led me to robin right was that and then when we for example when we did stack overflow were like okay well i really like elements of voting and dig and read it i like the wikipedia everythings up to date nothing is like an old tombstone that has horrible out of date information we know that works wikipedia is an amazing resource blogging the idea of ownership is so powerful right like oh i joe wrote this and look how good joes answer is right all these concepts were rolling together researching all the things that were out there that were working and why they were working and trying to fold them into again that frankensteins monster of what stack overflow is and by the way that wasnt a free decision because theres still a ton of tension in the stack overflow system theres reasons people complain about stack overflow because its so strict right why is it so strict why are you guys always closing my questions its because theres so much tension that we built into the system around trying to get good good results out of the system and its not a free that stuff doesnt come for free right its not like we we all have perfect answers and nobody will have to get their feelings heard or nobody will have to get downvoted it doesnt work that way right so this is an interesting point and a small tangent you write about anxiety so ive posted a lot of questions and written answers on stack overflow on the question side you usually go to something very specific to something im working on and this is something you talk about that really the goal of stack overflow isnt about is to write a question thats not about you its about the question that will help the community in the future right but thats a tough sell right because people are like well i dont really care about the community what i care about is my problem and thats fair right its sort of that again that tension that balancing act of we wanna help you but we also wanna help everybody that comes behind you the long line of people are gonna come up and say oh i kinda have that problem too right and if nobodys ever gonna come up and say i have this problem too then that question shouldnt exist on stack overflow because the question is too specific and even thats tension right how do you judge that how do you know that nobodys ever gonna have this particular question again so theres a lot of tension in the system do you think that anxiety of asking the question the anxiety of answering that tension is inherent to programmers is inherent to this kind of process or can it be improved can it be happy land where that tension is not quite so harsh i dont think stack overflow can totally change the way it works one thing they are working on finally is the ask page had not changed since 2011 im still kind of bitter about this because i feel like you have a qa system and what are the core pages in a qa system well first of all the question all the answers and also the ask page particularly when youre a new user or someone trying to ask a question thats the point at which you need the most help and we just didnt adapt with the times but the good news is theyre working on this from what i understand and its gonna be a more wizard based format and you could envision a world where as part of this wizard based program when youre asking questions okay come up with a good title what are good words to put in the title one word thats not good to put in the title is problem for example i have a problem oh you have a problem okay a problem thats great you need specifics so its trying to help you make a good question title for example that step will be broken out all that stuff but one of those steps in that wizard of asking could say hey im a little nervous ive never done this before can you put me in a queue for special mentoring you could opt in to a special mentor i think that would be fantastic i dont have any objection to that at all in terms of being an opt in system because there are people that are like i just wanna help them i wanna help a person no matter what i wanna go above and beyond i wanna spend hours with this person it depends what their goals are its a great idea who am i to judge so thats fine its not precluded from happening but theres a certain big city ethos that we started with like look were in new york city you dont come to new york city and expect them to be oh welcome to the city joe hows it going come on in let me show you around thats not how new york city works again new york city has a reputation for being rude which i actually dont think it is having been there fairly recently its not rude its just like going about their business like look i have things to do im busy im a busy professional as are you and since youre a busy professional certainly when you ask a question youre gonna ask the best possible question because youre a busy professional and you would not accept anything less than a very well written question with a lot of detail about why youre doing it what youre doing what you researched what you found because youre a professional like me and this rubs people sometimes the wrong way and i dont think its wrong to say look i dont want that experience i want just a more chill place for beginners and i still think stack overflow is not was never designed for beginners right theres this misconception that even joel says sometimes oh yeah stack overflow for beginners and i think if youre a prodigy it can be right but for the most part not but thats not really representative right like i think as a beginner you want a totally different set of tools you want like live screen sharing live chat you want access to resources you want a playground like a playground you can experiment in and like test and all this stuff that we just dont give people because that was never really the audience that we were designing stack overflow for that doesnt mean its wrong and i think it would be awesome if there was a site like that on the internet or if stack overflow said hey you know were gonna start doing this thats fine too you know im not there im not making those decisions but i do think the pressure the tension that you described is there for people to be look im a little nervous because i know i gotta do my best work right the other one is something you talk about which is also really interesting to me is duplicate questions or its a really difficult problem that you highlight its super hard like you could take one little topic and you could probably write 10 20 30 ways of asking about that topic and there will be all different i dont know if there should be one page that answers all of it is there a way that stack overflow can help disambiguate like separate these duplicate questions or connect them together or is it a totally hopeless difficult impossible task i think its a very very hard computer science problem and partly because people are very good at using completely different words it always amazed me on stack overflow youd have two questions that were functionally identical and one question had like zero words in common with the other question like oh my god from a computer science perspective how do you even begin to solve that and it happens all the time people are super good at this right accidentally at asking the same thing in like 10 20 different ways and the other complexity is we want some of those duplicates to exist because if theres five versions with different words have those five versions point to the one centralized answer right its like okay this is a duplicate no worries heres the answer that you wanted over here on the prime example that we want to have rather than having 10 copies of the question and the answer because if you have 10 copies of the question and answer this also devalues the reputation system which programmers hate as i previously mentioned youre getting reputation for an answer that somebody else already gave its like well its an answer but somebody else already gave that answer so why are you getting reputation for the same answer as the other guy who gave it four years ago people get offended by that right so the reputation system itself adds tension to the system in that the people who have a lot of reputation become very incentivized to enforce the reputation system and for the most part thats good i know it sounds weird but for most parts like look strict systems i think to use stack overflow you have to have the idea that ok strict systems ultimately work better and i do think in programming youre familiar with loose typing versus strict typing right the idea that you can declare a variable not declare a variable rather just start using a variable and ok i see its implicitly an integer bam awesome duck equals 5 well duck is now an integer of 5 right and youre like cool awesome simpler right why would i want to worry about typing and for a long time in the ruby community theyre like yeah this is awesome you just do a bunch of unit testing which is testing your programs validity after the fact to catch any bugs that strict typing of variables would have caught and now you have this thing called typescript for microsoft from the guy who built c sharp anders whos one of the greatest minds in software development right like in terms of language design and says no no no we want to bolt on a strict type system to javascript because it makes things better and now everybodys like oh my god we deployed typescript and found 50 latent bugs that we didnt know about right like this is super common so i think there is a truth in programming that strictness its not the goal were not saying be super strict because strictness is correct no its no no strictness produces better results thats what im saying right so strict typing of variables i would say you almost universally have consensus now is basically correct should be that way in every language right duck equals five should generate an error because no you didnt declare you didnt tell me that duck was an integer right thats a bug right or maybe you mistyped you typed deck instead of duck right you never know this happens all the time right so with that in mind i will say that the strictness of the system is correct now that doesnt mean cruel that doesnt mean mean that doesnt mean angry it just means strict ok so i think where theres misunderstanding is people get cranky right like another question you asked is like why are programmers kind of mean sometimes well who do programmers work with all day long so i have a theory that if youre at a job and you work with assholes all day long what do you eventually become an asshole an asshole and what is the computer except the worlds biggest asshole because the computer has no time for your bullshit the computer the minute you make a mistake everything is crashing down right one semicolon has crashed space missions right so thats normal so you begin to internalize that you begin to think oh my coworker the computer is super strict and kind of a jerk about everything so thats kind of how im going to be because i work with this computer and i have to exceed to its terms on everything so therefore you start to absorb that you start to think oh well being really strict arbitrarily is really good an error of error code 56249 is a completely good error message because thats what the computer gave me right so you kind of forget to be a person at some level and you know how they say great detectives internalize criminals and kind of are criminals themselves like this trope of the master detective is good because he can think like the criminal well i do think thats true of programmers really good programmers think like the computer because thats their job but if you internalize it too much you become the computer you kind of become a jerk to everybody because thats what youve internalized youre almost not a jerk but you have no patience for a lack of strictness as you said its not out of a sense of meanness its accidental but i do believe its an occupational hazard of being a programmer is you start to behave like the computer youre very unforgiving youre very terse youre very oh wrong incorrect move on its like well can you help me what could i do to fix no wrong next question like thats normal for the computer just fail next i dont know if you remember in saturday night live in the 90s they had this character who was an it guy the move guy move move was that jimmy fallon no no who played him ok yeah i remember move right he had no patience for it might have been mad tv actually wasnt it mad tv might have been but anyway thats always been the perception you start to behave like the computer its like oh youre wrong out of the way you know youve written so many blog posts about programming about programs programming programmers what do you think makes a good lets start with what makes a good solo programmer well i dont think you should be a solo programmer i think to be a good solo programmer its kind of like what i talked about well not on mike but one of the things john carmack one of the best points he makes in the book masters of doom which is a fantastic book and anybody listening to this who hasnt read it please read it its such a great book is that at the time they were working on stuff like wolfenstein and doom they didnt have the resources that we have today they didnt have stack overflow they didnt have wikipedia they didnt have discourse forums they didnt have places to go to get people to help them they had to work on their own and thats why it took a genius like carmack to do this stuff because you had to be a genius to invent from first principles a lot of the stuff he was like the hacks he was coming up with were genius genius level stuff but you dont need to be a genius anymore and that means not working by yourself you have to be good at researching stuff online you have to be good at asking questions really good questions that are really well researched which implies oh i went out and researched for three hours before i wrote these questions thats what you should be doing because thats whats going to make you good to me this is the big difference between programming in the 80s versus programming today is you kind of had to be by yourself back then where would you go for answers i remember in the early days when i was learning visual basic for windows i would call the microsoft helpline on the phone when i had programming because i was like i dont know what to do so i would go and call and they had these huge phone banks and im like can you imagine how alien that is now who would do that thats crazy so there was just nowhere else to go when you got stuck i had the books that came with it i read those studied those religiously i just saw a post from steve sanofsky that said the c version 7 came with 10000 pages of written material because where else were you going to figure that stuff out go to the library i mean you didnt have wikipedia you didnt have reddit you didnt have anywhere to go to answer these questions so youve talked about through the years basically not having an ego and not thinking that youre the best programmer in the world so always kind of just looking to improve to become a better programmer than you were yesterday so how have you changed as a programmer and as a thinker designer around programming over the past what is it 15 years really of being a public figure i would say the big insight that i had is eventually as a programmer you have to stop writing code to be effective which is kind of disturbing because you really love it but you realize being effective at programming at programming in the general sense doesnt mean writing code and a lot of times you can be much more successful by not writing code and writing code in terms of just solving the problems you have essentially hiring people that are really good and setting them free and giving them basic direction on strategy and stuff because a lot of the problems you encounter arent necessarily solved through really gnarly code theyre solved by conceptual solutions which can then be turned into code but are you even solving the right problem so i would say for me the main insight i have is to succeed as a programmer you eventually kind of stop writing code thats going to sound discouraging probably to people hearing but i dont mean it that way what i mean is that youre coding at a higher level language eventually like ok so were coding in assembly language thats the beginning right youre hardcoded to the architecture then you have stuff like c where its like wow we can abstract across the architecture we can write code i can then compile that code for arm or whatever x86 or whatever else is out there and then even higher level than that youre looking at python ruby interpreted languages and then to me as a programmer im like ok i want to go even higher i want to go higher than that how do i abstract higher than the language its like well you abstract in spoken language and written language right youre sort of inspiring people to get things done giving them guidance like what if we did this what if we did this youre writing in the highest level language that there is which is for me english whatever your spoken language is so its all about being effective right and i think patrick mckenzie patio11 on hacker news and works at stripe has a great post about this of how calling yourself a programmer is a career limiting move at some level once you get far enough from your career and i really believe that and again i apologize this is sound discouraging i dont mean it to be but hes so right because all the stuff that goes on around the code like the people thats another thing if you look at my early blog entries is about wow programming is about people more than its about code which doesnt really make sense but its about can these people even get along together can they understand each other can you even explain to me what it is youre working on are you solving the right problem peopleware another classic programming book which again up there with code complete please read peopleware its that software is people people are the software first and foremost so a lot of the skills that i was working on early in the blog were about figuring out the people parts of programming which were the harder parts the hard part of programming once you get a certain skill level in programming you can pretty much solve any reasonable problem thats put in front of you youre not writing algorithms from scratch that just doesnt happen so any sort of reasonable problem put in front of you youre going to be able to solve but what you cant solve is our manager is a total jerk you cannot solve that with code that is not a code solvable problem and yet that will cripple you way more than oh we had to use this stupid framework i dont like or sam keeps writing bad code that i hate or dave is off there in the wilderness writing god knows what these are not your problems your problem is your manager or a co worker is so toxic to everybody else in your team that nobody can get anything done because everybodys so stressed out and freaked out these are the problems that you have to attack absolutely and so as you go to these higher level abstractions as youve developed as a programmer to higher and higher level abstractions and go into natural language youre also the guy who preached building it diving in and doing it and learn by doing yes do you worry that as you get to higher and higher level abstractions you lose track of the lower level of just building do you worry about that even not maybe now but 10 years from now 20 years from now well no i mean there is always that paranoia around oh gosh i dont feel its valuable since im not writing code but for me when we started the discourse project it was ruby which i didnt really know ruby i mean as you pointed out and this is another valuable observation in stack overflow you can be super proficient in for example c sharp which i was working in thats what we built stack overflow in and still is written in and then switch to ruby and youre a newbie again but you have the framework i know what a for loop is i know what recursion is i know what a stack trace is i have all the fundamental concepts to be a programmer i just dont know ruby so im still on a higher level im not like a beginner beginner like youre saying im just like i need to apply my programming concepts i already know to ruby well so theres a question thats really interesting so looking at ruby how do you go about learning enough that your intuition can be applied carried over thats what i was trying to get to its like what i realized particularly when i started with just me and robin i realized if i bother robin i am now costing us productivity every time i go to robin rather than building our first alpha version of discourse hes now answering my stupid questions about ruby is that a good use of his time is that a good use of my time and the answer to both of those was resoundingly no we were getting to an alpha and it was pretty much just ok well hire more programmers we eventually hired neil and then eventually sam who came in as a cofounder actually it was sam first then neil later but the answer to the problem is just hire other competent programmers now i shall pull myself up by my bootstraps and learn ruby but at some point writing code becomes a liability to you in terms of getting things done theres so many other things that go on in the project like building the prototype you mentioned well how do you if youre not writing code how does everybody keep focus on what are we building well first basic mockups and research what do we even want to build theres a little bit of that that goes on but then very quickly you get to the prototype stage like build a prototype lets iterate on the prototype really really rapidly and thats what we do with discourse and thats what we demoed to get our seed funding for discourse was the alpha version of discourse that we had running and ready to go and it was very it was bad i mean it was ill just tell you it was bad we have screenshots of it im just embarrassed to look at it now but it was the prototype we were figuring out whats working whats not working because theres such a broad gap between the way you think things will work in your mind or even on paper and the way they work once you sit and live in the software like actually spend time living and breathing in software so different so my philosophy is get to a prototype and then what youre really optimizing for is speed of iteration like how you can turn the crank how quickly can we iterate thats the absolutely critical metric of any software project and i had a tweet recently that people liked and i totally this is so fundamental to what i do is like if you want to measure the core competency of any software tech company its the speed at which somebody can say hey we really need this word in the product change this word right because it will be more clear to the user like instead of respond its reply or something but theres some from the conception of that idea to how quickly that single word can be changed in your software and rolled out to users that is your life cycle thats your health your heartbeat if your heartbeat is like super slow youre basically dead no seriously like if it takes two weeks or even a month to get that single word changed everybodys like oh my god this is a great idea that word is so much clearer im talking about like a super like everybodys on board for this change its not like lets just change a word because were bored its like this is an awesome change and then it takes months to roll out its like well youre dead you cant iterate you cant how are you going to do anything right so anyway about the heartbeat its like get the prototype and then iterate on it thats what i view as the central tenet of modern software development thats fascinating that you put it that way so i work and i build autonomous vehicles and when you look at what maybe compare tesla to most other automakers the heart beat for tesla is literally days now in terms of they can over the air deploy software updates to all their vehicles which is markedly different than every other automaker which takes years to update a piece of software and thats reflected in everything thats the final product thats reflected in really how slowly they adapt to the times and to be clear im not saying being a hummingbird is the goal either', 'the following is a conversation with eric schmidt he was the ceo of google for 10 years and a chairman for six more guiding the company through an incredible period of growth and a series of world changing innovations he is one of the most impactful leaders in the era of the internet and the powerful voice for the promise of technology in our society it was truly an honor to speak with him as part of the mit course on artificial general intelligence and the artificial intelligence podcast and now heres my conversation with eric schmidt what was the first moment when you fell in love with technology i grew up in the 1960s as a boy where every boy wanted to be an astronaut and part of the space program so like everyone else of my age we would go out to the cow pasture behind my house which was literally a cow pasture and we would shoot model rockets off and that i think is the beginning and of course generationally today it would be video games and all the amazing things that you can do online with computers theres a transformative inspiring aspect of science and math that maybe rockets would bring would instill in individuals youve mentioned yesterday that eighth grade math is where the journey through mathematical universe diverges from many people its this fork in the roadway theres a professor of math at berkeley edward frankel he im not sure if youre familiar with him i am he has written this amazing book i recommend to everybody called love and math two of my favorite words he says that if painting was taught like math then the students would be asked to paint a fence which is his analogy of essentially how math is taught and so you never get a chance to discover the beauty of the art of painting or the beauty of the art of math so how when and where did you discover that beauty i think what happens with people like myself is that your math enabled pretty early and all of a sudden you discover that you can use that to discover new insights the great scientists will all tell a story the men and women who are fantastic today that somewhere when they were in high school or in college they discovered that they could discover something themselves and that sense of building something of having an impact that you own drives knowledge acquisition and learning in my case it was programming and the notion that i could build things that had not existed that i had built that it had my name on it and this was before open source but you could think of it as open source contributions so today if i were a 16 or 17 year old boy im sure that i would aspire as a computer scientist to make a contribution like the open source heroes of the world today that would be what would be driving me and id be trying and learning and making mistakes and so forth in the ways that it works the repository that github represents and that open source libraries represent is an enormous bank of knowledge of all of the people who are doing that and one of the lessons that i learned at google was that the world is a very big place and theres an awful lot of smart people and an awful lot of them are underutilized so heres an opportunity for example building parts of programs building new ideas to contribute to the greater of society so in that moment in the 70s the inspiring moment where there was nothing and then you created something through programming that magical moment so in 1975 i think youve created a program called lex which i especially like because my name is lex so thank you thank you for creating a brand that established a reputation thats long lasting reliable and has a big impact on the world and still used today so thank you for that but more seriously in that time in the 70s as an engineer personal computers were being born do you think youd be able to predict the 80s 90s and the aughts of where computers would go im sure i could not and would not have gotten it right i was the beneficiary of the great work of many many people who saw it clearer than i did with lex i worked with a fellow named michael lesk who was my supervisor and he essentially helped me architect and deliver a system thats still in use today after that i worked at xerox palo alto research center where the alto was invented and the alto is the predecessor of the modern personal computer or macintosh and so forth and the altos were very rare and i had to drive an hour from berkeley to go use them but i made a point of skipping classes and doing whatever it took to have access to this extraordinary achievement i knew that they were consequential what i did not understand was scaling i did not understand what would happen when you had 100 million as opposed to 100 and so the since then and i have learned the benefit of scale i always look for things which are going to scale to platforms right so mobile phones android all those things there are the world is in numerous there are many many people in the world people really have needs they really will use these platforms and you can build big businesses on top of them so its interesting so when you see a piece of technology now you think what will this technology look like when its in the hands of a billion people thats right so an example would be that the market is so competitive now that if you cant figure out a way for something to have a million users or a billion users it probably is not going to be successful because something else will become the general platform and your idea will become a lost idea or a specialized service with relatively few users so its a path to generality its a path to general platform use its a path to broad applicability now there are plenty of good businesses that are tiny so luxury goods for example but if you want to have an impact at scale you have to look for things which are of common value common pricing common distribution and solve common problems theyre problems that everyone has and by the way people have lots of problems information medicine health education and so forth work on those problems like you said youre a big fan of the middle class because theres so many of them theres so many of them by definition so any product any thing that has a huge impact and improves their lives is a great business decision and its just good for society and theres nothing wrong with starting off in the high end as long as you have a plan to get to the middle class theres nothing wrong with starting with a specialized market in order to learn and to build and to fund things so you start with a luxury market to build a general purpose market but if you define yourself as only a narrow market someone else can come along with a general purpose market that can push you to the corner can restrict the scale of operation can force you to be a lesser impact than you might be so its very important to think in terms of broad businesses and broad impact even if you start in a little corner somewhere so as you look to the 70s but also in the decades to come and you saw computers did you see them as tools or was there a little element of another entity i remember a quote saying ai began with our dream to create the gods is there a feeling when you wrote that program that you were creating another entity giving life to something i wish i could say otherwise but i simply found the technology platforms so exciting thats what i was focused on i think the majority of the people that ive worked with and there are a few exceptions steve jobs being an example really saw this as a great technological play i think relatively few of the technical people understood the scale of its impact so i used ncp which is a predecessor to tcpip it just made sense to connect things we didnt think of it in terms of the internet and then companies and then facebook and then twitter and then politics and so forth we never did that build we didnt have that vision and i think most people its a rare person who can see compounding at scale most people can see if you ask people to predict the future theyll give you an answer of six to nine months or 12 months because thats about as far as people can imagine but theres an old saying which actually was attributed to a professor at mit a long time ago that we overestimate what can be done in one year and we underestimate what can be done in a decade and theres a great deal of evidence that these core platforms at hardware and software take a decade right so think about self driving cars self driving cars were thought about in the 90s there were projects around them the first darpa grand challenge was roughly 2004 so thats roughly 15 years ago and today we have self driving cars operating in a city in arizona right its 15 years and we still have a ways to go before theyre more generally available so youve spoken about the importance you just talked about predicting into the future youve spoken about the importance of thinking five years ahead and having a plan for those five years the way to say it is that almost everybody has a one year plan almost no one has a proper five year plan and the key thing to having a five year plan is to having a model for whats going to happen under the underlying platforms so heres an example moores law as we know it the thing that powered improvements in cpus has largely halted in its traditional shrinking mechanism because the costs have just gotten so high its getting harder and harder but theres plenty of algorithmic improvements and specialized hardware improvements so you need to understand the nature of those improvements and where theyll go in order to understand how it will change the platform in the area of network connectivity what are the gains that are gonna be possible in wireless it looks like theres an enormous expansion of wireless connectivity at many different bands and that we will primarily historically ive always thought that we were primarily gonna be using fiber but now it looks like were gonna be using fiber plus very powerful high bandwidth sort of short distance connectivity to bridge the last mile thats an amazing achievement if you know that then youre gonna build your systems differently by the way those networks have different latency properties right because theyre more symmetric the algorithms feel faster for that reason and so when you think about whether its a fiber or just technologies in general so theres this barber wooden poem or quote that i really like its from the champions of the impossible rather than the slaves of the possible that evolution draws its creative force so in predicting the next five years id like to talk about the impossible and the possible well and again one of the great things about humanity is that we produce dreamers right we literally have people who have a vision and a dream they are if you will disagreeable in the sense that they disagree with the they disagree with what the sort of zeitgeist is they say there is another way they have a belief they have a vision if you look at science science is always marked by such people who went against some conventional wisdom collected the knowledge at the time and assembled it in a way that produced a powerful platform and youve been amazingly honest about in an inspiring way about things youve been wrong about predicting and youve obviously been right about a lot of things but in this kind of tension how do you balance as a company in predicting the next five years the impossible planning for the impossible so listening to those crazy dreamers letting them do letting them run away and make the impossible real make it happen and slow you know thats how programmers often think and slowing things down and saying well this is the rational this is the possible the pragmatic the dreamer versus the pragmatist so its helpful to have a model which encourages a predictable revenue stream as well as the ability to do new things so in googles case were big enough and well enough managed and so forth that we have a pretty good sense of what our revenue will be for the next year or two at least for a while and so we have enough cash generation that we can make bets and indeed google has become alphabet so the corporation is organized around these bets and these bets are in areas of fundamental importance to the world whether its artificial intelligence medical technology self driving cars connectivity through balloons on and on and on and theres more coming and more coming so one way you could express this is that the current business is successful enough that we have the luxury of making bets and another one that you could say is that we have the wisdom of being able to see that a corporate structure needs to be created to enhance the likelihood of the success of those bets so we essentially turned ourselves into a conglomerate of bets and then this underlying corporation google which is itself innovative so in order to pull this off you have to have a bunch of belief systems and one of them is that you have to have bottoms up and tops down the bottoms up we call 20 time and the idea is that people can spend 20 of the time whatever they want and the top down is that our founders in particular have a keen eye on technology and theyre reviewing things constantly so an example would be theyll hear about an idea or ill hear about something and it sounds interesting lets go visit them and then lets begin to assemble the pieces to see if thats possible and if you do this long enough you get pretty good at predicting whats likely to work so thats a beautiful balance that struck is this something that applies at all scale it seems to be that sergey again 15 years ago came up with a concept called 10 of the budget should be on things that are unrelated it was called 70 20 10 70 of our time on core business 20 on adjacent business and 10 on other and he proved mathematically of course hes a brilliant mathematician that you needed that 10 to make the sum of the growth work and it turns out he was right so getting into the world of artificial intelligence youve talked quite extensively and effectively to the impact in the near term the positive impact of artificial intelligence whether its especially machine learning in medical applications and education and just making information more accessible right in the ai community there is a kind of debate theres this shroud of uncertainty as we face this new world with artificial intelligence in it and theres some people like elon musk youve disagreed at least on the degree of emphasis he places on the existential threat of ai so ive spoken with stuart russell max tegmark who share elon musks view and yoshua bengio steven pinker who do not and so theres a lot of very smart people who are thinking about this stuff disagreeing which is really healthy of course so what do you think is the healthiest way for the ai community to and really for the general public to think about ai and the concern of the technology being mismanaged in some kind of way so the source of education for the general public has been robot killer movies right and terminator et cetera and the one thing i can assure you were not building are those kinds of solutions furthermore if they were to show up someone would notice and unplug them right so as exciting as those movies are and theyre great movies were the killer robots to start we would find a way to stop them right so im not concerned about that and much of this has to do with the timeframe of conversation so you can imagine a situation 100 years from now when the human brain is fully understood and the next generation and next generation of brilliant mit scientists have figured all this out were gonna have a large number of ethics questions right around science and thinking and robots and computers and so forth and so on so it depends on the question of the timeframe in the next five to 10 years were not facing those questions what were facing in the next five to 10 years is how do we spread this disruptive technology as broadly as possible to gain the maximum benefit of it the primary benefits should be in healthcare and in education healthcare because its obvious were all the same even though we somehow believe were not as a medical matter the fact that we have big data about our health will save lives allow us to deal with skin cancer and other cancers ophthalmological problems theres people working on psychological diseases and so forth using these techniques i can go on and on the promise of ai in medicine is extraordinary there are many many companies and startups and funds and solutions and we will all live much better for that the same argument in education can you imagine that for each generation of child and even adult you have a tutor educator thats ai based thats not a human but is properly trained that helps you get smarter helps you address your language difficulties or your math difficulties or what have you why dont we focus on those two the gains societally of making humans smarter and healthier are enormous and those translate for decades and decades and well all benefit from them there are people who are working on ai safety which is the issue that youre describing and there are conversations in the community that should there be such problems what should the rules be like google for example has announced its policies with respect to ai safety which i certainly support and i think most everybody would support and they make sense right so it helps guide the research but the killer robots are not arriving this year and theyre not even being built and on that line of thinking you said the time scale in this topic or other topics have you found it useful on the business side or the intellectual side to think beyond five 10 years to think 50 years out has it ever been useful or productive in our industry there are essentially no examples of 50 year predictions that have been correct lets review ai right ai which was largely invented here at mit and a couple of other universities in the 1956 1957 1958 the original claims were a decade or two and when i was a phd student i studied ai a bit and it entered during my looking at it a period which is known as ai winter which went on for about 30 years which is a whole generation of science scientists and a whole group of people who didnt make a lot of progress because the algorithms had not improved and the computers had not approved it took some brilliant mathematicians starting with a fellow named jeff hinton at toronto and montreal who basically invented this deep learning model which empowers us today the seminal work there was 20 years ago and in the last 10 years its become popularized so think about the timeframes for that level of discovery its very hard to predict many people think that well be flying around in the equivalent of flying cars who knows my own view if i wanna go out on a limb is to say that we know a couple of things about 50 years from now we know that therell be more people alive we know that well have to have platforms that are more sustainable because the earth is limited in the ways we all know and that the kind of platforms that are gonna get built will be consistent with the principles that ive described they will be much more empowering of individuals theyll be much more sensitive to the ecology because they have to be they just have to be i also think that humans are gonna be a great deal smarter and i think theyre gonna be a lot smarter because of the tools that ive discussed with you and of course people will live longer life extension is continuing apace a baby born today has a reasonable chance of living to 100 which is pretty exciting its well past the 21st century so we better take care of them and you mentioned an interesting statistic on some very large percentage 60 70 of people may live in cities today more than half the world lives in cities and one of the great stories of humanity in the last 20 years has been the rural to urban migration this has occurred in the united states its occurred in europe its occurring in asia and its occurring in africa when people move to cities the cities get more crowded but believe it or not their health gets better their productivity gets better their iq and educational capabilities improve so its good news that people are moving to cities but we have to make them livable and safe so you first of all you are but youve also worked with some of the greatest leaders in the history of tech what insights do you draw from the difference in leadership styles of yourself steve jobs elon musk larry page now the new ceo sandra pichai and others from the i would say calm sages to the mad geniuses one of the things that i learned as a young executive is that theres no single formula for leadership they try to teach one but thats not how it really works there are people who just understand what they need to do and they need to do it quickly those people are often entrepreneurs they just know and they move fast there are other people who are systems thinkers and planners thats more who i am somewhat more conservative more thorough in execution a little bit more risk of risk a little bit more risk averse theres also people who are sort of slightly insane in the sense that they are emphatic and charismatic and they feel it and they drive it and so forth theres no single formula to success there is one thing that unifies all of the people that you named which is very high intelligence at the end of the day the thing that characterizes all of them is that they saw the world quicker faster they processed information faster they didnt necessarily make the right decisions all the time but they were on top of it and the other thing thats interesting about all those people is they all started young so think about steve jobs starting apple roughly at 18 or 19 think about bill gates starting at roughly 20 21 think about by the time they were 30 mark zuckerberg a good example at 19 20 by the time they were 30 they had 10 years at 30 years old they had 10 years of experience of dealing with people and products and shipments and the press and business and so forth its incredible how much experience they had compared to the rest of us who were busy getting our phds yes exactly so we should celebrate these people because theyve just had more life experience right and that helps inform the judgment at the end of the day when youre at the top of these organizations all the easy questions have been dealt with right how should we design the buildings where should we put the colors on our product what should the box look like right the problems thats why its so interesting to be in these rooms the problems that they face right in terms of the way they operate the way they deal with their employees their customers their innovation are profoundly challenging each of the companies is demonstrably different culturally they are not in fact cut of the same they behave differently based on input their internal cultures are different their compensation schemes are different their values are different so theres proof that diversity works so so when faced with a tough decision in need of advice its been said that the best thing one can do is to find the best person in the world who can give that advice and find a way to be in a room with them one on one and ask so here we are and let me ask in a long winded way i wrote this down in 1998 there were many good search engines lycos excite altavista infoseek ask jeeves maybe yahoo even so google stepped in and disrupted everything they disrupted the nature of search the nature of our access to information the way we discover new knowledge so now its 2018 actually 20 years later there are many good personal ai assistants including of course the best from google so youve spoken in medical and education the impact of such an ai assistant could bring so we arrive at this question so its a personal one for me but i hope my situation represents that of many other as we said dreamers and the crazy engineers so my whole life ive dreamed of creating such an ai assistant every step ive taken has been towards that goal now im a research scientist in human centered ai here at mit so the next step for me as i sit here so facing my passion is to do what larry and sergey did in 98 this simple startup and so heres my simple question given the low odds of success the timing and luck required the countless other factors that cant be controlled or predicted which is all the things that larry and sergey faced is there some calculation some strategy to follow in this step or do you simply follow the passion just because theres no other choice i think the people who are in universities are always trying to study the extraordinarily chaotic nature of innovation and entrepreneurship my answer is that they didnt have that conversation they just did it they sensed a moment when in the case of google there was all of this data that needed to be organized and they had a better algorithm they had invented a better way so today with human centered ai which is your area of research there must be new approaches its such a big field there must be new approaches different from what we and others are doing there must be startups to fund there must be research projects to try there must be graduate students to work on new approaches here at mit there are people who are looking at learning from the standpoint of looking at child learning how do children learn starting at age one and two and the work is fantastic those approaches are different from the approach that most people are taking perhaps thats a bet that you should make or perhaps theres another one but at the end of the day the successful entrepreneurs are not as crazy as they sound they see an opportunity based on whats happened lets use uber as an example as travis sells the story he and his co founder were sitting in paris and they had this idea because they couldnt get a cab and they said we have smartphones and the rest is history so whats the equivalent of that travis eiffel tower where is a cab moment that you could as an entrepreneur take advantage of whether its in human centered ai or something else thats the next great startup and the psychology of that moment so when sergey and larry talk about and listen to a few interviews its very nonchalant well heres the very fascinating web data and heres an algorithm we have for we just kind of want to play around with that data and it seems like thats a really nice way to organize this data i should say what happened to remember is that they were graduate students at stanford and they thought this was interesting so they built a search engine and they kept it in their room and they had to get power from the room next door because they were using too much power in the room so they ran an extension cord over right and then they went and they found a house and they had google world headquarters of five people right to start the company and they raised 100000 from andy bechtolsheim who was the sun founder to do this and dave cheriton and a few others the point is their beginnings were very simple but they were based on a powerful insight that is a replicable model for any startup it has to be a powerful insight the beginnings are simple and there has to be an innovation in larry and sergeys case it was pagerank which was a brilliant idea one of the most cited papers in the world today whats the next one so youre one of if i may say richest people in the world and yet it seems that money is simply a side effect of your passions and not an inherent goal but youre a fascinating person to ask so much of our society at the individual level and at the company level and as nations is driven by the desire for wealth what do you think about this drive and what have you learned about if i may romanticize the notion the meaning of life having achieved success on so many dimensions there have been many studies of human happiness and above some threshold which is typically relatively low for this conversation theres no difference in happiness about money the happiness is correlated with meaning and purpose a sense of family a sense of impact so if you organize your life assuming you have enough to get around and have a nice home and so forth youll be far happier if you figure out what you care about and work on that its often being in service to others theres a great deal of evidence that people are happiest when theyre serving others and not themselves this goes directly against the sort of press induced excitement about powerful and wealthy leaders of one kind and indeed these are consequential people but if you are in a situation where youve been very fortunate as i have you also have to take that as a responsibility and you have to basically work both to educate others and give them that opportunity but also use that wealth to advance human society in my case im particularly interested in using the tools of artificial intelligence and machine learning to make society better ive mentioned education ive mentioned inequality and middle class and things like this all of which are a passion of mine it doesnt matter what you do it matters that you believe in it that its important to you and that your life will be far more satisfying if you spend your life doing that i think theres no better place to end than a discussion of the meaning of life eric thank you so much', 'the following is a conversation with stuart russell hes a professor of computer science at uc berkeley and a coauthor of a book that introduced me and millions of other people to the amazing world of ai called artificial intelligence a modern approach so it was an honor for me to have this conversation as part of mit course in artificial general intelligence and the artificial intelligence podcast if you enjoy it please subscribe on youtube itunes or your podcast provider of choice or simply connect with me on twitter at lex friedman spelled f r i d and now heres my conversation with stuart russell so youve mentioned in 1975 in high school youve created one of your first ai programs that play chess were you ever able to build a program that beat you at chess or another board game so my program never beat me at chess i actually wrote the program at imperial college so i used to take the bus every wednesday with a box of cards this big and shove them into the card reader and they gave us eight seconds of cpu time it took about five seconds to read the cards in and compile the code so we had three seconds of cpu time which was enough to make one move you know with a not very deep search and then we would print that move out and then wed have to go to the back of the queue and wait to feed the cards in again how deep was the search are we talking about one move two moves three moves no i think we got an eight move a depth eight with alpha beta and we had some tricks of our own about move ordering and some pruning of the tree but you were still able to beat that program yeah yeah i was a reasonable chess player in my youth i did an othello program and a backgammon program so when i got to berkeley i worked a lot on what we call meta reasoning which really means reasoning about reasoning and in the case of a game playing program you need to reason about what parts of the search tree youre actually going to explore because the search tree is enormous bigger than the number of atoms in the universe and the way programs succeed and the way humans succeed is by only looking at a small fraction of the search tree and if you look at the right fraction you play really well if you look at the wrong fraction if you waste your time thinking about things that are never going to happen moves that no ones ever going to make then youre going to lose because you wont be able to figure out the right decision so that question of how machines can manage their own computation how they decide what to think about is the meta reasoning question and we developed some methods for doing that and very simply the machine should think about whatever thoughts are going to improve its decision quality we were able to show that both for othello which is a standard two player game and for backgammon which includes dice rolls so its a two player game with uncertainty for both of those cases we could come up with algorithms that were actually much more efficient than the standard alpha beta search which chess programs at the time were using and that those programs could beat me and i think you can see the same basic ideas in alpha go and alpha zero today the way they explore the tree is using a form of meta reasoning to select what to think about based on how useful it is to think about it is there any insights you can describe with our greek symbols of how do we select which paths to go down theres really two kinds of learning going on so as you say alpha go learns to evaluate board positions so it can look at a go board and it actually has probably a superhuman ability to instantly tell how promising that situation is to me the amazing thing about alpha go is not that it can be the world champion with its hands tied behind his back but the fact that if you stop it from searching altogether so you say okay youre not allowed to do any thinking ahead you can just consider each of your legal moves and then look at the resulting situation and evaluate it so what we call a depth one search so just the immediate outcome of your moves and decide if thats good or bad that version of alpha go can still play at a professional level and human professionals are sitting there for five 10 minutes deciding what to do and alpha go in less than a second can instantly intuit what is the right move to make based on its ability to evaluate positions and that is remarkable because we dont have that level of intuition about go we actually have to think about the situation so anyway that capability that alpha go has is one big part of why it beats humans the other big part is that its able to look ahead 40 50 60 moves into the future and if it was considering all possibilities 40 or 50 or 60 moves into the future that would be 10 to the 200 possibilities so way more than atoms in the universe and so on so its very very selective about what it looks at so let me try to give you an intuition about how you decide what to think about its a combination of two things one is how promising it is so if youre already convinced that a move is terrible theres no point spending a lot more time convincing yourself that its terrible because its probably not going to change your mind so the real reason you think is because theres some possibility of changing your mind about what to do and its that changing your mind that would result then in a better final action in the real world so thats the purpose of thinking is to improve the final action in the real world so if you think about a move that is guaranteed to be terrible you can convince yourself its terrible youre still not going to change your mind but on the other hand suppose you had a choice between two moves one of them youve already figured out is guaranteed to be a draw lets say and then the other one looks a little bit worse it looks fairly likely that if you make that move youre going to lose but theres still some uncertainty about the value of that move theres still some possibility that it will turn out to be a win then its worth thinking about that so even though its less promising on average than the other move which is a good move its worth thinking about on average than the other move which is guaranteed to be a draw theres still some purpose in thinking about it because theres a chance that you will change your mind and discover that in fact its a better move so its a combination of how good the move appears to be and how much uncertainty there is about its value the more uncertainty the more its worth thinking about because theres a higher upside if you want to think of it that way and of course in the beginning especially in the alphago zero formulation everything is shrouded in uncertainty so youre really swimming in a sea of uncertainty so it benefits you to i mean actually following the same process as you described but because youre so uncertain about everything you basically have to try a lot of different directions yeah so the early parts of the search tree are fairly bushy that it will look at a lot of different possibilities but fairly quickly the degree of certainty about some of the moves i mean if a move is really terrible youll pretty quickly find out right you lose half your pieces or half your territory and then youll say okay this is not worth thinking about anymore and then so further down the tree becomes very long and narrow and youre following various lines of play 10 20 30 40 50 moves into the future and that again is something that human beings have a very hard time doing mainly because they just lack the short term memory you just cant remember a sequence of moves thats 50 moves long and you cant imagine the board correctly for that many moves into the future of course the top players im much more familiar with chess but the top players probably have they have echoes of the same kind of intuition instinct that in a moments time alphago applies when they see a board i mean theyve seen those patterns human beings have seen those patterns before at the top at the grandmaster level it seems that there is some similarities or maybe its our imagination creates a vision of those similarities but it feels like this kind of pattern recognition that the alphago approaches are using is similar to what human beings at the top level are using i think theres theres some truth to that but not entirely yeah i mean i think the the extent to which a human grandmaster can reliably instantly recognize the right move and instantly recognize the value of the position i think thats a little bit overrated but if you sacrifice a queen for example i mean theres these theres these beautiful games of chess with bobby fischer somebody where its seeming to make a bad move and im not sure theres a perfect degree of calculation involved where theyve calculated all the possible things that happen but theres an instinct there right that somehow adds up to yeah so i think what happens is you you you get a sense that theres some possibility in the position even if you make a weird looking move that it opens up some some lines of of calculation that otherwise would be definitely bad and and its that intuition that theres something here in this position that might might yield a win and then you follow that right and and in some sense when a when a chess player is following a line and in his or her mind theyre theyre mentally simulating what the other person is going to do what the opponent is going to do and they can do that as long as the moves are kind of forced right as long as theres you know theres a a fort we call a forcing variation where the opponent doesnt really have much choice how to respond and then you follow that how to respond and then you see if you can force them into a situation where you win you know we see plenty of mistakes even even in grandmaster games where they just miss some simple three four five move combination that you know wasnt particularly apparent in in the position but was still there thats the thing that makes us human yeah so when you mentioned that in othello those games were after some matter reasoning improvements and research was able to beat you how did that make you feel part of the meta reasoning capability that it had was based on learning and and you could sit down the next day and you could just feel that it had got a lot smarter you know and all of a sudden you really felt like youre sort of pressed against the wall because it was it was much more aggressive and and was totally unforgiving of any minor mistake that you might make and and actually it seemed understood the game better than i did and gary kasparov has this quote where during his match against deep blue he said he suddenly felt that there was a new kind of intelligence across the board do you think thats a scary or an exciting possibility for for kasparov and for yourself in in the context of chess purely sort of in this like that feeling whatever that is i think its definitely an exciting feeling you know this is what made me work on ai in the first place was as soon as i really understood what a computer was i wanted to make it smart you know i started out with the first program i wrote was for the sinclair programmable calculator and i think you could write a 21 step algorithm that was the biggest program you could write something like that and do little arithmetic calculations so i think i implemented newtons method for a square roots and a few other things like that but then you know i thought okay if i just had more space i could make this thing intelligent and so i started thinking about ai and and i think the the the thing thats scary is not is not the chess program because you know chess programs theyre not in the taking over the world business but if you extrapolate you know there are things about chess that dont resemble the real world right we know we know the rules of chess the chess board is completely visible to the program where of course the real world is not most most of the real world is is not visible from wherever youre sitting so to speak and to overcome those kinds of problems you need qualitatively different algorithms another thing about the real world is that you know we we regularly plan ahead on the timescales involving billions or trillions of steps now we dont plan those in detail but you know when you choose to do a phd at berkeley thats a five year commitment and that amounts to about a trillion motor control steps that you will eventually be committed to including going up the stairs opening doors drinking water yeah i mean every every finger movement while youre typing every character of every paper and the thesis and everything so youre not committing in advance to the specific motor control steps but youre still reasoning on a timescale that will eventually reduce to trillions of motor control actions and so for all of these reasons you know alphago and deep blue and so on dont represent any kind of threat to humanity but they are a step towards it right and progress in ai occurs by essentially removing one by one these assumptions that make problems easy like the assumption of complete observability of the situation right we remove that assumption you need a much more complicated kind of computing design it needs it needs something that actually keeps track of all the things you cant see and tries to estimate whats going on and theres inevitable uncertainty in that so it becomes a much more complicated problem but you know we are removing those assumptions we are starting to have algorithms that can cope with much longer timescales that can cope with uncertainty that can cope with partial observability and so each of those steps sort of magnifies by a thousand the range of things that we can do with ai systems so the way i started in ai i wanted to be a psychiatrist for a long time i wanted to understand the mind in high school and of course program and so on and i showed up university of illinois to an ai lab and they said okay i dont have time for you but heres a book ai and modern approach i think it was the first edition at the time here go go go learn this and i remember the lay of the land was well its incredible that we solved chess but well never solve go i mean it was pretty certain that go in the way we thought about systems that reason wasnt possible to solve and now weve solved this so its a very well i think i would have said that its unlikely we could take the kind of algorithm that was used for chess and just get it to scale up and work well for go and at the time what we thought was that in order to solve go we would have to do something similar to the way humans manage the complexity of go which is to break it down into kind of sub games so when a human thinks about a go board they think about different parts of the board as sort of weakly connected to each other and they think about okay within this part of the board heres how things could go in that part of board heres how things could go and then you try to sort of couple those two analyses together and deal with the interactions and maybe revise your views of how things are going to go in each part and then youve got maybe five six seven ten parts of the board and that actually resembles the real world much more than chess does because in the real world we have work we have home life we have sport different kinds of activities shopping these all are connected to each other but theyre weakly connected so when im typing a paper i dont simultaneously have to decide which order im going to get the milk and the butter that doesnt affect the typing but i do need to realize okay i better finish this before the shops close because i dont have anything i dont have any food at home so theres some weak connection but not in the way that chess works where everything is tied into a single stream of thought so the thought was that to solve go wed have to make progress on stuff that would be useful for the real world and in a way alphago is a little bit disappointing right because the program designed for alphago is actually not that different from deep blue or even from arthur samuels checker playing program from the 1950s and in fact the two things that make alphago work is one is this amazing ability to evaluate the positions and the other is the meta reasoning capability which allows it to explore some paths in the tree very deeply and to abandon other paths very quickly including yourself because youre on camera now and your voice is coming through with high resolution yeah so you could take what im saying and replace it with pretty much anything else you wanted me to be saying and its a very simple thing take what im saying and replace it with pretty much anything else you wanted me to be saying and even it would change my lips and facial expressions to fit and theres actually not much in the way of real legal protection against that i think in the commercial area you could say yeah youre using my brand and so on there are rules about that but in the political sphere i think at the moment anything goes that could be really really damaging and let me just try to make not an argument but try to look back at history and say something dark in essence is while regulation seems to be oversight seems to be exactly the right thing to do here it seems that human beings what they naturally do is they wait for something to go wrong if youre talking about nuclear weapons you cant talk about nuclear weapons being dangerous until somebody actually like the united states drops the bomb or chernobyl melting do you think we will have to wait for things going wrong in a way thats obviously damaging to society not an existential risk but obviously damaging or do you have faith that i hope not but i think we do have to look at history and so the two examples you gave nuclear weapons and nuclear power are very very interesting because nuclear weapons we knew in the early years of the 20th century that atoms contained a huge amount of energy we had e equals mc squared we knew the mass differences between the different atoms and their components and we knew that you might be able to make an incredibly powerful explosive so hg wells wrote science fiction book i think in 1912 frederick soddy who was the guy who discovered isotopes the nobel prize winner he gave a speech in 1915 saying that one pound of this new explosive would be the equivalent of 150 tons of dynamite which turns out to be about right and this was in world war i so he was imagining how much worse the world war would be if we were using that kind of explosive but the physics establishment simply refused to believe that these things could be made including the people who are making it well so they were doing the nuclear physics i mean eventually were the ones who made it you talk about fermi or whoever well so up to the development was mostly theoretical so it was people using sort of primitive kinds of particle acceleration and doing experiments at the level of single particles or collections of particles they werent yet thinking about how to actually make a bomb or anything like that but they knew the energy was there and they figured if they understood it better it might be possible but the physics establishment their view and i think because they did not want it to be true their view was that it could not be true that this could not not provide a way to make a super weapon and there was this famous speech given by rutherford who was the sort of leader of nuclear physics and it was on september 11th 1933 and he said anyone who talks about the possibility of obtaining energy from transformation of atoms is talking complete moonshine and the next morning leo szilard read about that speech and then invented the nuclear chain reaction and so as soon as he invented as soon as he had that idea that you could make a chain reaction with neutrons because neutrons were not repelled by the nucleus so they could enter the nucleus and then continue the reaction as soon as he has that idea he instantly realized that the world was in deep doo doo because this is 1933 right hitler had recently come to power in germany szilard was in london and eventually became a refugee and came to the us and in the process of having the idea about the chain reaction he figured out basically how to make a bomb and also how to make a reactor and he patented the reactor in 1934 but because of the situation the great power conflict situation that he could see happening he kept that a secret and so between then and the beginning of world war ii people were working including the germans on how to actually create neutron sources what specific fission reactions would produce neutrons of the right energy to continue the reaction and that was demonstrated in germany i think in 1938 if i remember correctly the first nuclear weapon patent was 1939 by the french so this was actually going on well before world war ii really got going and then the british probably had the most advanced capability in this area but for safety reasons among others and just resources they moved the program from britain to the us and then that became manhattan project so the reason why we couldnt have any kind of oversight of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology was because we were basically already in an arms race and a war lr but you mentioned then in the 20s and 30s so what are the echoes the way youve described this story i mean theres clearly echoes why do you think most ai researchers folks who are really close to the metal they really are not concerned about ai they dont think about it whether its they dont want to think about it but why do you think that is is what are the echoes of the nuclear situation to the current ai situation and what can we do about it bf i think there is a kind of motivated cognition which is a term in psychology means that you believe what you would like to be true rather than what is true and its unsettling to think that what youre working on might be the end of the human race obviously so you would rather instantly deny it and come up with some reason why it couldnt be true and i have i collected a long list of reasons that extremely intelligent competent ai scientists have come up with for why we shouldnt worry about this for example calculators are superhuman at arithmetic and they havent taken over the world so theres nothing to worry about well okay my five year old you know could have figured out why that was an unreasonable and really quite weak argument another one was while its theoretically possible that you could have superhuman ai destroy the world its also theoretically possible that a black hole could materialize right next to the earth and destroy humanity i mean yes its theoretically possible quantum theoretically extremely unlikely that it would just materialize right there but thats a completely bogus analogy because you know if the whole physics community on earth was working to materialize a black hole in near earth orbit right wouldnt you ask them is that a good idea is that going to be safe you know what if you succeed right and thats the thing right the ai community is sort of refused to ask itself what if you succeed and initially i think that was because it was too hard but you know alan turing asked himself that and he said wed be toast right if we were lucky we might be able to switch off the power but probably wed be toast but theres also an aspect that because were not exactly sure what the future holds its not clear exactly so technically what to worry about sort of how things go wrong and so there is something it feels like maybe you can correct me if im wrong but theres something paralyzing about worrying about something that logically is inevitable but you have to think about it logically is inevitable but you dont really know what that will look like yeah i think thats its a reasonable point and you know its certainly in terms of existential risks its different from you know asteroid collides with the earth right which again is quite possible you know its happened in the past itll probably happen again we dont know right now but if we did detect an asteroid that was going to hit the earth in 75 years time wed certainly be doing something about it well its clear theres got big rock and theres well probably have a meeting and see what do we do about the big rock with ai right with ai i mean there are very few people who think its not going to happen within the next 75 years i know rod brooks doesnt think its going to happen maybe andrew ng doesnt think its happened but you know a lot of the people who work day to day you know as you say at the rock face they think its going to happen i think the median estimate from ai researchers is somewhere in 40 to 50 years from now or maybe you know i think in asia they think its going to be even faster than that im a little bit more conservative i think itd probably take longer than that but i think you know as happened with nuclear weapons it can happen overnight that you have these breakthroughs and we need more than one breakthrough but you know its on the order of half a dozen i mean this is a very rough scale but sort of half a dozen breakthroughs of that nature would have to happen for us to reach the superhuman ai but the you know the ai research community is vast now the massive investments from governments from corporations tons of really really smart people you know you just have to look at the rate of progress in different areas of ai to see that things are moving pretty fast so to say oh its just going to be thousands of years i dont see any basis for that you know i see you know for example the stanford 100 year ai project right which is supposed to be sort of you know the serious establishment view their most recent report actually said its probably not even possible oh wow right which if you want a perfect example of people in denial thats it because you know for the whole history of ai weve been saying to philosophers who said it wasnt possible well you have no idea what youre talking about of course its possible right give me an argument for why it couldnt happen and there isnt one right and now because people are worried that maybe ai might get a bad name or i just dont want to think about this theyre saying okay well of course its not really possible you know imagine if you know the leaders of the cancer biology community got up and said well you know of course curing cancer its not really possible thered be complete outrage and dismay and you know i find this really a strange phenomenon so okay so if you accept that its possible and if you accept that its probably going to happen the point that youre making that you know how does it go wrong a valid question without that without an answer to that question then youre stuck with what i call the gorilla problem which is you know the problem that the gorillas face right they made something more intelligent than them namely us a few million years ago and now theyre in deep doo doo so theres really nothing they can do theyve lost the control they failed to solve the control problem of controlling humans and so theyve lost so we dont want to be in that situation and if the gorilla problem is the only formulation you have theres not a lot you can do right other than to say okay we should try to stop you know we should just not make the humans or in this case not make the ai and i think thats really hard to do im not actually proposing that thats a feasible course of action i also think that you know if properly controlled ai could be incredibly beneficial but it seems to me that theres a consensus that one of the major failure modes is this loss of control that we create ai systems that are pursuing incorrect objectives and because the ai system believes it knows what the objective is it has no incentive to listen to us anymore so to speak right its just carrying out the strategy that it has computed as being the optimal solution and you know it may be that in the process it needs to acquire more resources to increase the possibility of success or prevent various failure modes by defending itself against interference and so that collection of problems i think is something we can address the other problems are roughly speaking you know misuse right so even if we solve the control problem we make perfectly safe controllable ai systems well why you know why does dr evil going to use those right he wants to just take over the world and hell make unsafe ai systems that then get out of control so thats one problem which is sort of a you know partly a policing problem partly a sort of a cultural problem for the profession of how we teach people what kinds of ai systems are safe you talk about autonomous weapon system and how pretty much everybody agrees that theres too many ways that that can go horribly wrong this great slaughterbots movie that kind of illustrates that beautifully i want to talk about that thats another theres another topic im having to talk about i just want to mention that what i see is the third major failure mode which is overuse not so much misuse but overuse of ai that we become overly dependent so i call this the wall e problem so if youve seen wall e the movie all right all the humans are on the spaceship and the machines look after everything for them and they just watch tv and drink big gulps and theyre all sort of obese and stupid and they sort of totally lost any notion of human autonomy and you know so in effect right this would happen like the slow boiling frog right we would gradually turn over more and more of the management of our civilization to machines as we are already doing and this you know if this if this process continues you know we sort of gradually switch from sort of being the masters of technology to just being the guests right so we become guests on a cruise ship you know which is fine for a week but not not for the rest of eternity you know and its almost irreversible right once you once you lose the incentive to for example you know learn to be an engineer or a doctor or a sanitation operative or any other of the infinitely many ways that we maintain and propagate our civilization you know if you if you dont have the incentive to do any of that you wont and then its really hard to recover and of course as just one of the technologies that could that third failure mode result in that theres probably other technology in general detaches us from it does a bit but the difference is that in terms of the knowledge to to run our civilization you know up to now weve had no alternative but to put it into peoples heads right and if you software with google i mean so software in general so computers in general but but the you know the knowledge of how you know how a sanitation system works you know thats an ai has to understand that its no good putting it into google so i mean we weve always put knowledge in on paper but paper doesnt run our civilization and only runs when it goes from the paper into peoples heads again right so weve always propagated civilization through human minds and weve spent about a trillion person years doing that i literally write you you can work it out its about right theres about just over 100 billion people whove ever lived and each of them has spent about 10 years learning stuff to keep their civilization going and so thats a trillion person years we put into this effort beautiful way to describe all civilization and now were you know were in danger of throwing that away so this is a problem that ai cant solve its not a technical problem its you know if we do our job right the ai systems will say you know the human race doesnt in the long run want to be passengers in a cruise ship the human race wants autonomy this is part of human preferences so we the ai systems are not going to do this stuff for you youve got to do it for yourself right im not going to carry you to the top of everest in an autonomous helicopter you have to climb it if you want to get the benefit and so on so but im afraid that because we are short sighted and lazy were going to override the ai systems and and theres an amazing short story that i recommend to everyone that i talked to about this called the machine stops written in 1909 by em forster who you know wrote novels about the british empire and sort of things that became costume dramas on the bbc but he wrote this one science fiction story which is an amazing vision of the future it has basically ipads it has video conferencing it has moocs it has computer induced obesity i mean literally its what people spend their time doing is giving online courses or listening to online courses and talking about ideas but they never get out there in the real world they dont really have a lot of face to face contact everything is done online you know so all the things were worrying about now were described in the story and and then the human race becomes more and more dependent on the machine loses knowledge of how things really run and then becomes vulnerable to collapse and so its a its a pretty unbelievably amazing story for someone writing in 1909 to imagine all this so theres very few people that represent artificial intelligence more than you stuart russell if you say its okay thats very kind so its all my fault right youre often brought up as the person well stuart russell like the ai person is worried about this thats why you should be worried about it do you feel the burden of that i dont know if you feel that at all but when i talk to people like from you talk about people outside of computer science when they think about this stuart russell is worried about ai safety you should be worried too do you feel the burden of that i mean in a practical sense yeah because i get you know a dozen sometimes 25 invitations a day to talk about it to give interviews to write press articles and so on so in that very practical sense im seeing that people are concerned and really interested about this are you worried that you could be wrong as all good scientists are of course i worry about that all the time i mean thats thats always been the way that i ive worked you know is like i have an argument in my head with myself right so i have i have some idea and then i think okay how could that be wrong or did someone else already have that idea so ill go and you know search in as much literature as i can to see whether someone else already thought of that or or even refuted it so you know i right now im im reading a lot of philosophy because you know in in the form of the debates over over utilitarianism and and other kinds of moral moral formulas shall we say people have already thought through some of these issues but you know what one of the things im im not seeing in a lot of these debates is this specific idea about the importance of uncertainty in the objective that this is the way we should think about machines that are beneficial to humans so this idea of provably beneficial machines based on explicit uncertainty in the objective you know it seems to be you know my gut feeling is this is the core of it its going to have to be elaborated in a lot of different directions and there are a lot of beneficial yeah but there there are i mean it has to be right we cant afford you know hand wavy beneficial because there are you know whenever we do hand wavy stuff there are loopholes and the thing about super intelligent machines is they find the loopholes you know just like you know tax evaders if you dont write your tax law properly people will find the loopholes and end up paying no tax and and so you should think of it this way and and getting those definitions right you know it is really a long process you know so you can you can define mathematical frameworks and within that framework you can prove mathematical theorems that yes this will you know this this theoretical entity will be provably beneficial to that theoretical entity but that framework may not match the real world in some crucial way so its a long process thinking through it iterating and so on last question yep you have 10 seconds to answer it what is your favorite sci fi movie about ai i would say interstellar has my favorite robots oh beats space yeah yeah yeah so so tars the robots one of the robots in interstellar is the way robot should behave and uh i would say ex machina is in some ways the one the one that makes you think uh in a nervous kind of way about about where were going well stuart thank you so much for talking today pleasure so this word meta reasoning while technically correct inspires perhaps the wrong degree of power that alphago has for example the word reasoning is a powerful word so let me ask you sort of you were part of the symbolic ai world for a while like ai was theres a lot of excellent interesting ideas there that unfortunately met a winter and so do you think it reemerges so i would say yeah its not quite as simple as that so the ai winter for the first winter that was actually named as such was the one in the late 80s and that came about because in the mid 80s there was a really a concerted attempt to push ai out into the real world using what was called expert system technology and for the most part that technology was just not ready for primetime they were trying in many cases to do a form of uncertain reasoning judgment combinations of evidence diagnosis those kinds of things which was simply invalid and when you try to apply invalid reasoning methods to real problems you can fudge it for small versions of the problem but when it starts to get larger the thing just falls apart so many companies found that the stuff just didnt work and they were spending tons of money on consultants to try to make it work and there were other practical reasons like they were asking the companies to buy incredibly expensive lisp machine workstations which were literally between 50000 and 100000 in 1980s money which would be like between 150000 and 300000 per workstation in current prices and then the bottom line they werent seeing a profit from it yeah in many cases i think there were some successes theres no doubt about that but people i would say overinvested every major company was starting an ai department just like now and i worry a bit that we might see similar disappointments not because the current technology is invalid but its limited in its scope and its almost the duel of the scope problems that expert systems had so what have you learned from that hype cycle and what can we do to prevent another winter for example yeah so when im giving talks these days thats one of the warnings that i give so this is a two part warning slide one is that rather than data being the new oil data is the new snake oil thats a good line and then the other is that we might see a kind of very visible failure in some of the major application areas and i think self driving cars would be the flagship and i think when you look at the history so the first self driving car was on the freeway driving itself changing lanes overtaking in 1987 and so its more than 30 years and that kind of looks like where we are today right you know prototypes on the freeway changing lanes and overtaking now i think thats one of the things thats been made particularly on the perception side so we worked a lot on autonomous vehicles in the early mid 90s at berkeley and we had our own big demonstrations we put congressmen into self driving cars and had them zooming along the freeway and the problem was clearly perception at the time the problem was perception yeah so in simulation with perfect perception you could actually show that you can drive safely for a long time even if the other cars are misbehaving and so on but simultaneously we worked on machine vision for detecting cars and tracking pedestrians and so on and we couldnt get the cars to do that and so we had to do that for pedestrians and so on and we couldnt get the reliability of detection and tracking up to a high enough level particularly in bad weather conditions nighttime rainfall good enough for demos but perhaps not good enough to cover the general operation yeah so the thing about driving is you know suppose youre a taxi driver you know and you drive every day eight hours a day for 10 years right thats 100 million seconds of driving you know and any one of those seconds you can make a fatal mistake so youre talking about eight nines of reliability right now if your vision system only detects 983 of the vehicles right then thats sort of you know one in a bit nines of reliability so you have another seven orders of magnitude to go and this is what people dont understand they think oh because i had a successful demo im pretty much done but youre not even within seven orders of magnitude of being done and thats the difficulty and its not the can i follow a white line thats not the problem right we follow a white line all the way across the country but its the weird stuff that happens its all the edge cases yeah the edge case other drivers doing weird things you know so if you talk to google right so they had actually a very classical architecture where you know you had machine vision which would detect all the other cars and pedestrians and the white lines and the road signs and then basically that was fed into a logical database and then you had a classical 1970s rule based expert system telling you okay if youre in the middle lane and theres a bicyclist in the right lane who is signaling this then you do that right and what they found was that every day theyd go out and thered be another situation that the rules didnt cover you know so theyd come to a traffic circle and theres a little girl riding her bicycle the wrong way around the traffic circle okay what do you do we dont have a rule oh my god okay stop and then you know they come back and add more rules and they just found that this was not really converging and if you think about it right how do you deal with an unexpected situation meaning one that youve never previously encountered and the sort of reasoning required to figure out the solution for that situation has never been done it doesnt match any previous situation in terms of the kind of reasoning you have to do well you know in chess programs this happens all the time right youre constantly coming up with situations you havent seen before and you have to reason about them and you have to think about okay here are the possible things i could do here are the outcomes heres how desirable the outcomes are and then pick the right one you know in the 90s we were saying okay this is how youre going to have to do automated vehicles theyre going to have to have a look ahead capability but the look ahead for driving is more difficult than it is for chess because theres humans and theyre less predictable than chess pieces well then you have an opponent in chess whos also somewhat unpredictable but for example in chess you always know the opponents intention theyre trying to beat you right whereas in driving you dont know is this guy trying to turn left or has he just forgotten to turn off his turn signal or is he drunk or is he changing the channel on his radio or whatever it might be youve got to try and figure out the mental state the intent of the other drivers to forecast the possible evolutions of their trajectories and then youve got to figure out okay which is the trajectory for me thats going to be safest and those all interact with each other because the other drivers are going to react to your trajectory and so on so you know theyve got the classic merging onto the freeway problem where youre kind of racing a vehicle thats already on the freeway and youre going to pull ahead of them or youre going to let them go first and pull in behind and you get this sort of uncertainty about whos going first so all those kinds of things mean that you need a decision making architecture thats very different from either a rule based system or it seems to me kind of an end to end neural network system so just as alphago is pretty good when it doesnt do any look ahead but its way way way way better when it does i think the same is going to be true for driving you can have a driving system thats pretty good when it doesnt do any look ahead but thats not good enough and weve already seen multiple deaths caused by poorly designed machine learning algorithms that dont really understand what theyre doing yeah on several levels i think on the perception side theres mistakes being made by those algorithms where the perception is very shallow on the planning side the look ahead like you said and the thing that we come up against thats really interesting when you try to deploy systems in the real world is you cant think of an artificial intelligence system as a thing that responds to the world always you have to realize that its an agent that others will respond to as well so in order to drive successfully you cant just try to do obstacle avoidance right you cant pretend that youre invisible right youre the invisible car right it doesnt work that way i mean but you have to assert yet others have to be scared of you just were all theres this tension theres this game so if we study a lot of work with pedestrians if you approach pedestrians as purely an obstacle avoidance so youre doing look ahead as in modeling the intent that theyre not going to theyre going to take advantage of you theyre not going to respect you at all there has to be a tension a fear some amount of uncertainty thats how we have created or at least just a kind of a resoluteness you have to display a certain amount of resoluteness you cant be too tentative and yeah so the solutions then become pretty complicated right you get into game theoretic analyses and so at berkeley now were working a lot on this kind of interaction between machines and humans and thats exciting and so my colleague ankur dragan actually if you formulate the problem game theoretically you just let the system figure out the solution it does interesting unexpected things like sometimes at a stop sign if no one is going first the car will actually back up a little right and just to indicate to the other cars that they should go and thats something it invented entirely by itself we didnt say this is the language of communication at stop signs it figured it out thats really interesting so let me one just step back for a second just this beautiful philosophical notion so pamela mccordick in 1979 wrote ai began with the ancient wish to forge the gods so when you think about the history of our civilization do you think that there is an inherent desire to create lets not say gods but to create superintelligence is it inherent to us is it in our genes that the natural arc of human civilization is to create things that are of greater and greater power and perhaps echoes of ourselves so to create the gods as pamela said maybe i mean were all individuals but certainly we see over and over again in history individuals who thought about this possibility hopefully when im not being too philosophical here but if you look at the arc of this where this is going and well talk about ai safety well talk about greater and greater intelligence do you see that there in when you created the othello program and you felt this excitement what was that excitement was it excitement of a tinkerer who created something cool like a clock or was there a magic or was it more like a child being born yeah so i mean i certainly understand that viewpoint and if you look at the lighthill report which was so in the 70s there was a lot of controversy in the uk about ai and whether it was for real and how much money the government should invest and there was a long story but the government commissioned a report by lighthill who was a physicist and he wrote a very damning report about ai which i think was the point and he said that these are frustrated men who are unable to have children would like to create and create a life as a kind of replacement which i think is really pretty unfair but there is a kind of magic i would say when you build something and what youre building in is really just youre building in some understanding of the principles of learning and decision making and to see those principles actually then turn into intelligent behavior in specific situations its an incredible thing and that is naturally going to make you think okay where does this end and so theres magical optimistic views of where it ends whatever your view of optimism is whatever your view of utopia is its probably different for everybody but youve often talked about concerns you have of how things may go wrong so ive talked to max tegmark theres a lot of interesting ways to think about ai safety youre one of the seminal people thinking about this problem amongst sort of being in the weeds of actually solving specific ai problems youre also thinking about the big picture of where are we going so can you talk about several elements of it lets just talk about maybe the control problem so this idea of losing ability to control the behavior in our ai system so how do you see that how do you see that coming about what do you think we can do to manage it well so it doesnt take a genius to realize that if you make something thats smarter than you you might have a problem alan turing wrote about this and gave lectures about this in 1951 he did a lecture on the radio and he basically says once the machine thinking method starts very quickly theyll outstrip humanity and if were lucky we might be able to turn off the power at strategic moments but even so our species would be humbled actually he was wrong about that if its sufficiently intelligent machine its not going to let you switch it off its actually in competition with you so what do you think is most likely going to happen what do you think is meant just for a quick tangent if we shut off this super intelligent machine that our species will be humbled i think he means that we would realize that we are inferior right that we only survive by the skin of our teeth because we happen to get to the off switch just in time and if we hadnt then we would have lost control over the earth are you more worried when you think about this stuff about super intelligent ai or are you more worried about super powerful ai thats not aligned with our values so the paperclip scenarios kind of so the main problem im working on is the control problem the problem of machines pursuing objectives that are as you say not aligned with human objectives and this has been the way weve thought about ai since the beginning you build a machine for optimizing and then you put in some objective and it optimizes right and we can think of this as the king midas problem right because if the king midas put in this objective everything i touch should turn to gold and the gods thats like the machine they said okay done you now have this power and of course his father his drink and his family all turned to gold and then he dies of misery and starvation and its a warning its a failure mode that pretty much every culture in history has had some story along the same lines theres the genie that gives you three wishes and the third wish is always you know please undo the first two wishes because i messed up and when arthur samuel wrote his checker playing program which learned to play checkers considerably better than arthur samuel could play and actually reached a pretty decent standard norbert wiener who was one of the major mathematicians of the 20th century hes sort of the father of modern automation control systems he saw this and he basically extrapolated as turing did and said okay this is how we could lose control and specifically that we have to be certain that the purpose we put into the machine is the purpose which we really desire and the problem is we cant do that you mean were not its a very difficult to encode to put our values on paper is really difficult or youre just saying its impossible so theoretically its possible but in practice its extremely unlikely that we could specify correctly in advance the full range of concerns of humanity you talked about cultural transmission of values i think is how humans to human transmission of values happens right well we learn yeah i mean as we grow up we learn about the values that matter how things should go what is reasonable to pursue and what isnt reasonable to pursue you think machines can learn in the same kind of way yeah so i think that what we need to do is to get away from this idea that you build an optimising machine and then you put the objective into it because if its possible that you might put in a wrong objective and we already know this is possible because its happened lots of times right that means that the machine should never take an objective thats given as gospel truth because once it takes the objective as gospel truth then it believes that whatever actions its taking in pursuit of that objective are the correct things to do so you could be jumping up and down and saying no no no no youre going to destroy the world but the machine knows what the true objective is and is pursuing it and tough luck to you and this is not restricted to ai right this is i think many of the 20th century technologies right so in statistics you minimise a loss function the loss function is exogenously specified in control theory you minimise a cost function in operations research you maximise a reward function and so on so in all these disciplines this is how we conceive of the problem and its the wrong problem because we cannot specify with certainty the correct objective right we need uncertainty we need the machine to be uncertain about what it is that its supposed to be maximising favourite idea of yours ive heard you say somewhere well i shouldnt pick favourites but it just sounds beautiful we need to teach machines humility its a beautiful way to put it i love it that theyre humble they know that they dont know what it is theyre supposed to be doing and that those objectives i mean they exist theyre within us but we may not be able to we may not be able to explicate them we may not even know how we want our future to go exactly and the machine a machine thats uncertain is going to be deferential to us so if we say dont do that well now the machines learn something a bit more about our true objectives because something that it thought was reasonable in pursuit of our objective turns out not to be so now its learned something so its going to defer because it wants to be doing what we really want and that point i think is absolutely central to solving the control problem and its a different kind of ai when you take away this idea that the objective is known then in fact a lot of the theoretical frameworks that were so familiar with you know markov decision processes goal based planning you know standard games research all of these techniques actually become inapplicable and you get a more complicated problem because now the interaction with the human becomes part of the problem because the human by making choices is giving you more information about the true objective and that information helps you achieve the objective better and so that really means that youre mostly dealing with game theoretic problems where youve got the machine and the human and theyre coupled together rather than a machine going off by itself with a fixed objective lw which is fascinating on the machine and the human level that we when you dont have an objective means youre together coming up with an objective i mean theres a lot of philosophy that you know you could argue that life doesnt really have meaning we together agree on what gives it meaning and we kind of culturally create things that give why the heck we are on this earth anyway we together as a society create that meaning and you have to learn that objective and one of the biggest i thought thats where you were going to go for a second one of the biggest troubles we run into outside of statistics and machine learning and ai and just human civilization is when you look at i came from i was born in the soviet union and the history of the 20th century we ran into the most trouble us humans when there was a certainty about the objective and you do whatever it takes to achieve that objective whether youre talking about germany or communist russia you get into trouble with humans i would say with you know corporations in fact some people argue that you know we dont have to look forward to a time when ai systems take over the world they already have and they call corporations right that corporations happen to be using people as components right now but they are effectively algorithmic machines and theyre optimizing an objective which is quarterly profit that isnt aligned with overall wellbeing of the human race and they are destroying the world they are primarily responsible for our inability to tackle climate change so i think thats one way of thinking about whats going on with corporations but i think the point youre making is valid that there are many systems in the real world where weve sort of prematurely fixed on the objective and then decoupled the machine from those thats supposed to be serving and i think you see this with government right government is supposed to be a machine that serves people but instead it tends to be taken over by people who have their own objective and use government to optimize that objective regardless of what people want do you find appealing the idea of almost arguing machines where you have multiple ai systems with a clear fixed objective we have in government the red team and the blue team theyre very fixed on their objectives and they argue and they kind of may disagree but it kind of seems to make it work somewhat that the duality of it okay lets go a hundred years back when there was still was going on or at the founding of this country there was disagreements and that disagreement is where so it was a balance between certainty and forced humility because the power was distributed yeah i think that the nature of debate and disagreement argument takes as a premise the idea that you could be wrong which means that youre not necessarily absolutely convinced that your objective is the correct one if you were absolutely convinced thered be no point in having any discussion or argument because you would never change your mind and there wouldnt be any sort of synthesis or anything like that i think you can think of argumentation as an implementation of a form of uncertain reasoning ive been reading recently about utilitarianism and the history of efforts to define in a sort of clear mathematical way if you like a formula for moral or political decision making its really interesting that the parallels between the philosophical discussions going back 200 years and what you see now in discussions about existential risk because its almost exactly the same someone would say okay well heres a formula for how we should make decisions utilitarianism is roughly each person has a utility function and then we make decisions to maximize the sum of everybodys utility then people point out well in that case the best policy is one that leads to the enormously vast population all of whom are living a life thats barely worth living this is called the repugnant conclusion another version is that we should maximize pleasure and thats what we mean by utility then youll get people effectively saying well in that case we might as well just have everyone hooked up to a heroin drip they didnt use those words but that debate was happening in the 19th century as it is now about ai that if we get the formula wrong were going to have ai systems working towards an outcome that in retrospect would be exactly wrong do you think theres as beautifully put so the echoes are there but do you think i mean if you look at sam harris our imagination worries about the ai version of that because of the speed at which the things going wrong in the utilitarian context could happen is that a worry for you yeah i think that in most cases not in all but if we have a wrong political idea we see it starting to go wrong and were not completely stupid and so we say okay maybe that was a mistake lets try something different also were very slow and inefficient about implementing these things and so on so you have to worry when you have corporations or political systems that are extremely efficient but when we look at ai systems or even just computers in general they have this different characteristic from ordinary human activity in the past so lets say you were a surgeon you had some idea about how to do some operation well and lets say you were wrong that way of doing the operation would mostly kill the patient well youd find out pretty quickly like after three maybe three or four tries but that isnt true for pharmaceutical companies because they dont do three or four operations they manufacture three or four billion pills and they sell them and then they find out maybe six months or a year later that oh people are dying of heart attacks or getting cancer from this drug and so thats why we have the fda right because of the scalability of pharmaceutical production and there have been some unbelievably bad episodes in the history of pharmaceuticals and adulteration of products and so on that have killed tens of thousands or paralyzed hundreds of thousands of people now with computers we have that same scalability problem that you can sit there and type for i equals one to five billion do right and all of a sudden youre having an impact on a global scale and yet we have no fda right theres absolutely no controls at all over what a bunch of undergraduates with too much caffeine can do to the world and we look at what happened with facebook well social media in general and click through optimization so you have a simple feedback algorithm thats trying to just optimize click through right that sounds reasonable right because you dont want to be feeding people ads that they dont care about or not interested in and you might even think of that process as simply adjusting the feeding of ads or news articles or whatever it might be to match peoples preferences right which sounds like a good idea but in fact that isnt how the algorithm works right you make more money the algorithm makes more money if it can better predict what people are going to click on because then it can feed them exactly that right so the way to maximize click through is actually to modify the people to make them more predictable and one way to do that is to feed them information which will change their behavior and preferences towards extremes that make them predictable whatever is the nearest extreme or the nearest predictable point thats where youre going to end up and the machines will force you there and i think theres a reasonable argument to say that this among other things is contributing to the destruction of democracy in the world and where was the oversight of this process where were the people saying okay you would like to apply this algorithm to 5 billion people on the face of the earth can you show me that its safe can you show me that it wont have various kinds of negative effects no there was no one asking that question there was no one placed between the undergrads with too much caffeine and the human race they just did it but some way outside the scope of my knowledge so economists would argue that the what is it the invisible hand so the capitalist system it was the oversight so if youre going to corrupt society with whatever decision you make as a company then thats going to be reflected in people not using your product thats one model of oversight we shall see but in the meantime but you might even have broken the political system that enables capitalism to function well youve changed it we shall see change is often painful so my question is absolutely its fascinating youre absolutely right that there was zero oversight on algorithms that can have a profound civilization changing effect so do you think its possible i mean i havent have you seen government so do you think its possible to create regulatory bodies oversight over ai algorithms which are inherently such cutting edge set of ideas and technologies yeah but i think it takes time to figure out what kind of oversight what kinds of controls i mean it took time to design the fda regime you know and some people still dont like it and they want to fix it and i think there are clear ways that it could be improved but the whole notion that you have stage one stage two stage three and here are the criteria for what you have to do to pass a stage one trial right we havent even thought about what those would be for algorithms so i mean i think there are things we could do right now with regard to bias for example we have a pretty good technical handle on how to detect algorithms that are propagating bias that exists in data sets how to de bias those algorithms and even what its going to cost you to do that so i think we could start having some standards on that i think there are things to do with impersonation and falsification that we could work on fakes yeah a very simple point so impersonation is a machine acting as if it was a person i cant see a real justification for why we shouldnt insist that machines self identify as machines where is the social benefit in fooling people into thinking that this is really a person when it isnt i dont mind if it uses a human like voice thats easy to understand thats fine but it should just say im a machine in some form and how many people are speaking to that i would think relatively obvious facts yeah i mean there is actually a law in california that bans impersonation but only in certain restricted circumstances so for the purpose of engaging in a fraudulent transaction and for the purpose of modifying someones voting behavior so those are the circumstances where machines have to self identify but i think arguably it should be in all circumstances and then when you talk about deep fakes were just at the beginning but already its possible to make a movie of anybody saying anything in ways that are pretty hard to detect', 'the following is a conversation with peter abbeel hes a professor at uc berkeley and the director of the berkeley robotics learning lab hes one of the top researchers in the world working on how we make robots understand and interact with the world around them especially using imitation and deep reinforcement learning this conversation is part of the mit course on artificial general intelligence and the artificial intelligence podcast if you enjoy it please subscribe on youtube itunes or your podcast provider of choice or simply connect with me on twitter at lex friedman spelled f r i d and now heres my conversation with peter abbeel youve mentioned that if there was one person you could meet it would be roger federer so let me ask when do you think well have a robot that fully autonomously can beat roger federer at tennis roger federer level player at tennis well first if you can make it happen for me to meet roger let me know in terms of getting a robot to beat him at tennis its kind of an interesting question because for a lot of the challenges we think about in ai the software is really the missing piece but for something like this the hardware is nowhere near either to really have a robot that can physically run around the boston dynamics robots are starting to get there but still not really human level ability to run around and then swing a racket so you think thats a hardware problem i dont think its a hardware problem only i think its a hardware and a software problem i think its both and i think theyll have independent progress so id say the hardware maybe in 10 15 years on clay not grass i mean grass is probably harder with the sliding yeah with the clay im not sure whats harder grass or clay the clay involves sliding which might be harder to master actually yeah but youre not limited to a bipedal i mean im sure theres no well if we can build a machine its a whole different question of course if you can say okay this robot can be on wheels it can move around on wheels and can be designed differently then i think that can be done sooner probably than a full humanoid type of setup what do you think of swing a racket so youve worked at basic manipulation how hard do you think is the task of swinging a racket would be able to hit a nice backhand or a forehand lets say we just set up stationary a nice robot arm lets say a standard industrial arm and it can watch the ball come and then swing the racket its a good question im not sure it would be super hard to do i mean im sure it would require a lot if we do it with reinforcement learning it would require a lot of trial and error its not gonna swing it right the first time around but yeah i dont see why i couldnt swing it the right way i think its learnable i think if you set up a ball machine lets say on one side and then a robot with a tennis racket on the other side i think its learnable and maybe a little bit of pre training and simulation yeah i think thats feasible i think the swing the racket is feasible itd be very interesting to see how much precision it can get cause i mean thats where i mean some of the human players can hit it on the lines which is very high precision with spin the spin is an interesting whether rl can learn to put a spin on the ball well you got me interested maybe someday well set this up sure you got me intrigued your answer is basically okay for this problem it sounds fascinating but for the general problem of a tennis player we might be a little bit farther away whats the most impressive thing youve seen a robot do in the physical world so physically for me its the boston dynamics videos always just bring home and just super impressed recently the robot running up the stairs doing the parkour type thing i mean yes we dont know whats underneath they dont really write a lot of detail but even if its hard coded underneath which it might or might not be just the physical abilities of doing that parkour thats a very impressive so have you met spot mini or any of those robots in person met spot mini last year in april at the mars event that jeff bezos organizes they brought it out there and it was nicely following around jeff when jeff left the room they had it follow him along which is pretty impressive so i think theres some confidence to know that theres no learning going on in those robots the psychology of it so while knowing that while knowing theres not if theres any learning going on its very limited i met spot mini earlier this year and knowing everything thats going on having one on one interaction so i got to spend some time alone and theres immediately a deep connection on the psychological level even though you know the fundamentals how it works theres something magical so do you think about the psychology of interacting with robots in the physical world even you just showed me the pr2 the robot and there was a little bit something like a face had a little bit something like a face theres something that immediately draws you to it do you think about that aspect of the robotics problem well its very hard with brad here well give him a name berkeley robot for the elimination of tedious tasks its very hard to not think of the robot as a person and it seems like everybody calls him a he for whatever reason but that also makes it more a person than if it was a it and it seems pretty natural to think of it that way this past weekend really struck me ive seen pepper many times on videos but then i was at an event organized by this was by fidelity and they had scripted pepper to help moderate some sessions and they had scripted pepper to have the personality of a child a little bit and it was very hard to not think of it as its own person in some sense because it would just jump in the conversation making it very interactive moderate would be saying pepper would just jump in hold on how about me can i participate in this too and youre just like okay this is like a person and that was 100 scripted and even then it was hard not to have that sense of somehow there is something there so as we have robots interact in this physical world is that a signal that could be used in reinforcement learning youve worked a little bit in this direction but do you think that psychology can be somehow pulled in yes thats a question i would say a lot of people ask and i think part of why they ask it is theyre thinking about how unique are we really still as people like after they see some results they see a computer play go they see a computer do this that theyre like okay but can it really have emotion can it really interact with us in that way and then once youre around robots you already start feeling it and i think that kind of maybe mythologically the way that i think of it is if you run something like reinforcement learning its about optimizing some objective and theres no reason that the objective couldnt be tied into how much does a person like interacting with this system and why could not the reinforcement learning system optimize for the robot being fun to be around and why wouldnt it then naturally become more and more interactive and more and more maybe like a person or like a pet i dont know what it would exactly be but more and more have those features and acquire them automatically as long as you can formalize an objective of what it means to like something what how you exhibit whats the ground truth how do you get the reward from human because you have to somehow collect that information within you human but youre saying if you can formulate as an objective it can be learned theres no reason it couldnt emerge through learning and maybe one way to formulate as an objective you wouldnt have to necessarily score it explicitly so standard rewards are numbers and numbers are hard to come by this is a 15 or a 17 on some scale its very hard to do for a person but much easier is for a person to say okay what you did the last five minutes was much nicer than what you did the previous five minutes and that now gives a comparison and in fact there have been some results on that for example paul christiano and collaborators at openai had the hopper mojoko hopper a one legged robot going through backflips purely from feedback i like this better than that thats kind of equally good and after a bunch of interactions it figured out what it was the person was asking for namely a backflip and so i think the same thing oh it wasnt trying to do a backflip it was just getting a comparison score from the person based on person having in mind in their own mind i wanted to do a backflip but the robot didnt know what it was supposed to be doing it just knew that sometimes the person said this is better this is worse and then the robot figured out what the person was actually after was a backflip and id imagine the same would be true for things like more interactive robots that the robot would figure out over time oh this kind of thing apparently is appreciated more than this other kind of thing so when i first picked up suttons richard suttons reinforcement learning book before sort of this deep learning before the reemergence of neural networks as a powerful mechanism for machine learning rl seemed to me like magic it was beautiful so that seemed like what intelligence is rl reinforcement learning so how do you think we can possibly learn anything about the world when the reward for the actions is delayed is so sparse like where is why do you think rl works why do you think you can learn anything under such sparse rewards whether its regular reinforcement learning or deep reinforcement learning whats your intuition the counterpart of that is why is rl why does it need so many samples so many experiences to learn from because really whats happening is when you have a sparse reward you do something maybe for like i dont know you take 100 actions and then you get a reward and maybe you get like a score of three and im like okay three not sure what that means you go again and now you get two and now you know that that sequence of 100 actions that you did the second time around somehow was worse than the sequence of 100 actions you did the first time around but thats tough to now know which one of those were better or worse some might have been good and bad in either one and so thats why it needs so many experiences but once you have enough experiences effectively rl is teasing that apart its trying to say okay what is consistently there when you get a higher reward and whats consistently there when you get a lower reward and then kind of the magic of sometimes the policy gradient update is to say now lets update the neural network to make the actions that were kind of present when things are good more likely and make the actions that are present when things are not as good less likely so that is the counterpoint but it seems like you would need to run it a lot more than you do even though right now people could say that rl is very inefficient but it seems to be way more efficient than one would imagine on paper that the simple updates to the policy the policy gradient that somehow you can learn exactly you just said what are the common actions that seem to produce some good results that that somehow can learn anything it seems counterintuitive at least is there some intuition behind it yeah so i think theres a few ways to think about this the way i tend to think about it mostly originally so when we started working on deep reinforcement learning here at berkeley which was maybe 2011 12 13 around that time john schulman was a phd student initially kind of driving it forward here and the way we thought about it at the time was if you think about rectified linear units or kind of rectifier type neural networks what do you get you get something thats piecewise linear feedback control and if you look at the literature linear feedback control is extremely successful can solve many many problems surprisingly well i remember for example when we did helicopter flight if youre in a stationary flight regime not a non stationary but a stationary flight regime like hover you can use linear feedback control to stabilize a helicopter very complex dynamical system but the controller is relatively simple and so i think thats a big part of it is that if you do feedback control even though the system you control can be very very complex often relatively simple control architectures can already do a lot but then also just linear is not good enough and so one way you can think of these neural networks is that sometimes they tile the space which people were already trying to do more by hand or with finite state machines say this linear controller here this linear controller here neural network learns to tile the space and say linear controller here another linear controller here but its more subtle than that and so its benefiting from this linear control aspect its benefiting from the tiling but its somehow tiling it one dimension at a time because if lets say you have a two layer network if in that hidden layer you make a transition from active to inactive or the other way around that is essentially one axis but not axis aligned but one direction that you change and so you have this kind of very gradual tiling of the space where you have a lot of sharing between the linear controllers that tile the space and that was always my intuition as to why to expect that this might work pretty well its essentially leveraging the fact that linear feedback control is so good but of course not enough and this is a gradual tiling of the space with linear feedback controls that share a lot of expertise across them so thats really nice intuition but do you think that scales to the more and more general problems of when you start going up the number of dimensions when you start going down in terms of how often you get a clean reward signal does that intuition carry forward to those crazier weirder worlds that we think of as the real world so i think where things get really tricky in the real world compared to the things weve looked at so far with great success in reinforcement learning is the time scales which takes us to an extreme so when you think about the real world i mean i dont know maybe some student decided to do a phd here right okay thats a decision thats a very high level decision but if you think about their lives i mean any persons life its a sequence of muscle fiber contractions and relaxations and thats how you interact with the world and thats a very high frequency control thing but its ultimately what you do and how you affect the world until i guess we have brain readings and you can maybe do it slightly differently but typically thats how you affect the world and the decision of doing a phd is so abstract relative to what youre actually doing in the world and i think thats where credit assignment becomes just completely beyond what any current rl algorithm can do and we need hierarchical reasoning at a level that is just not available at all yet where do you think we can pick up hierarchical reasoning by which mechanisms yeah so maybe let me highlight what i think the limitations are of what already was done 20 30 years ago in fact youll find reasoning systems that reason over relatively long horizons but the problem is that they were not grounded in the real world so people would have to hand design some kind of logical dynamical descriptions of the world and that didnt tie into perception and so it didnt tie into real objects and so forth and so that was a big gap now with deep learning we start having the ability to really see with sensors process that and understand whats in the world and so its a good time to try to bring these things together i see a few ways of getting there one way to get there would be to say deep learning can get bolted on somehow to some of these more traditional approaches now bolted on would probably mean you need to do some kind of end to end training where you say my deep learning processing somehow leads to a representation that in term uses some kind of traditional underlying dynamical systems that can be used for planning and thats for example the direction aviv tamar and thanard kuretach here have been pushing with causal info again and of course other people too thats one way can we somehow force it into the form factor that is amenable to reasoning another direction weve been thinking about for a long time and didnt make any progress on was more information theoretic approaches so the idea there was that what it means to take high level action is to take and choose a latent variable now that tells you a lot about whats gonna be the case in the future because thats what it means to take a high level action i say okay i decide im gonna navigate to the gas station because i need to get gas for my car well thatll now take five minutes to get there but the fact that i get there i could already tell that from the high level action i took much earlier that we had a very hard time getting success with not saying its a dead end necessarily but we had a lot of trouble getting that to work and then we started revisiting the notion of what are we really trying to achieve what were trying to achieve is not necessarily hierarchy per se but you could think about what does hierarchy give us what we hope it would give us is better credit assignment what is better credit assignment its giving us it gives us faster learning right and so faster learning is ultimately maybe what were after and so thats where we ended up with the rl squared paper on learning to reinforcement learn which at a time rocky dwan led and thats exactly the meta learning approach where you say okay we dont know how to design hierarchy we know what we want to get from it lets just enter and optimize for what we want to get from it and see if it might emerge and we saw things emerge the maze navigation had consistent motion down hallways which is what you want a hierarchical control should say i want to go down this hallway and then when there is an option to take a turn i can decide whether to take a turn or not and repeat even had the notion of where have you been before or not to not revisit places youve been before it still didnt scale yet to the real world kind of scenarios i think you had in mind but it was some sign of life that maybe you can meta learn these hierarchical concepts i mean it seems like through these meta learning concepts get at the what i think is one of the hardest and most important problems of ai which is transfer learning so its generalization how far along this journey towards building general systems are we being able to do transfer learning well so theres some signs that you can generalize a little bit but do you think were on the right path or its totally different breakthroughs are needed to be able to transfer knowledge between different learned models yeah im pretty torn on this in that i think there are some very impressive well theres just some very impressive results already i mean i would say when even with the initial kind of big breakthrough in 2012 with alexnet the initial thing is okay great this does better on imagenet hence image recognition but then immediately thereafter there was of course the notion that wow what was learned on imagenet and you now wanna solve a new task you can fine tune alexnet for new tasks and that was often found to be the even bigger deal that you learn something that was reusable which was not often the case before usually machine learning you learn something for one scenario and that was it and thats really exciting i mean thats a huge application thats probably the biggest success of transfer learning today in terms of scope and impact that was a huge breakthrough and then recently i feel like similar kind of by scaling things up it seems like this has been expanded upon like people training even bigger networks they might transfer even better if you looked at for example some of the openai results on language models and some of the recent google results on language models theyre learned for just prediction and then they get reused for other tasks and so i think there is something there where somehow if you train a big enough model on enough things it seems to transfer some deep mind results that i thought were very impressive the unreal results where it was learned to navigate mazes in ways where it wasnt just doing reinforcement learning but it had other objectives it was optimizing for so i think theres a lot of interesting results already i think maybe where its hard to wrap my head around this to which extent or when do we call something generalization or the levels of generalization in the real world or the levels of generalization involved in these different tasks right you draw this by the way just to frame things ive heard you say somewhere its the difference between learning to master versus learning to generalize that its a nice line to think about and i guess youre saying that its a gray area of what learning to master and learning to generalize where one starts i think i might have heard this i might have heard it somewhere else and i think it mightve been one of your interviews maybe the one with yoshua benjamin im not 100 sure but i liked the example im not sure who it was but the example was essentially if you use current deep learning techniques what were doing to predict lets say the relative motion of our planets it would do pretty well but then now if a massive new mass enters our solar system it would probably not predict what will happen right and thats a different kind of generalization thats a generalization that relies on the ultimate simplest simplest explanation that we have available today to explain the motion of planets whereas just pattern recognition could predict our current solar system motion pretty well no problem and so i think thats an example of a kind of generalization that is a little different from what weve achieved so far and its not clear if just regularizing more and forcing it to come up with a simpler simpler simpler explanation and say look this is not simple but thats what physics researchers do right they say can i make this even simpler how simple can i get this whats the simplest equation that can explain everything the master equation for the entire dynamics of the universe we havent really pushed that direction as hard in deep learning i would say not sure if it should be pushed but it seems a kind of generalization you get from that that you dont get in our current methods so far so i just talked to vladimir vapnik for example whos a statistician of statistical learning and he kind of dreams of creating the e equals mc squared for learning right the general theory of learning do you think thats a fruitless pursuit in the near term within the next several decades i think thats a really interesting pursuit in the following sense in that there is a lot of evidence that the brain is pretty modular and so i wouldnt maybe think of it as the theory maybe the underlying theory but more kind of the principle where there have been findings where people who are blind will use the part of the brain usually used for vision for other functions and even after some kind of if people get rewired in some way they might be able to reuse parts of their brain for other functions and so what that suggests is some kind of modularity and i think it is a pretty natural thing to strive for to see can we find that modularity can we find this thing of course every part of the brain is not exactly the same not everything can be rewired arbitrarily but if you think of things like the neocortex which is a pretty big part of the brain that seems fairly modular from what the findings so far can you design something equally modular and if you can just grow it it becomes more capable probably i think that would be the kind of interesting underlying principle to shoot for that is not unrealistic do you think you prefer math or empirical trial and error for the discovery of the essence of what it means to do something intelligent so reinforcement learning embodies both groups right to prove that something converges prove the bounds and then at the same time a lot of those successes are well lets try this and see if it works so which do you gravitate towards how do you think of those two parts of your brain maybe i would prefer we could make the progress with mathematics and the reason maybe i would prefer that is because often if you have something you can mathematically formalize you can leapfrog a lot of experimentation and experimentation takes a long time to get through and a lot of trial and error kind of reinforcement learning your research process but you need to do a lot of trial and error before you get to a success so if you can leapfrog that to my mind thats what the math is about and hopefully once you do a bunch of experiments you start seeing a pattern you can do some derivations that leapfrog some experiments but i agree with you i mean in practice a lot of the progress has been such that we have not been able to find the math that allows you to leapfrog ahead and we are kind of making gradual progress one step at a time a new experiment here a new experiment there that gives us new insights and gradually building up but not getting to something yet where were just okay heres an equation that now explains how you know that would be have been two years of experimentation to get there but this tells us what the results going to be unfortunately not so much yet not so much yet but your hope is there in trying to teach robots or systems to do everyday tasks or even in simulation what do you think youre more excited about imitation learning or self play so letting robots learn from humans or letting robots plan their own to try to figure out in their own way and eventually play eventually interact with humans or solve whatever the problem is whats the more exciting to you whats more promising you think as a research direction so when we look at self play whats so beautiful about it is goes back to kind of the challenges in reinforcement learning so the challenge of reinforcement learning is getting signal and if you dont never succeed you dont get any signal in self play youre on both sides so one of you succeeds and the beauty is also one of you fails and so you see the contrast you see the one version of me that did better than the other version so every time you play yourself you get signal and so whenever you can turn something into self play youre in a beautiful situation where you can naturally learn much more quickly than in most other reinforcement learning environments so i think if somehow we can turn more reinforcement learning problems into self play formulations that would go really really far so far self play has been largely around games where there is natural opponents but if we could do self play for other things and lets say i dont know a robot learns to build a house i mean thats a pretty advanced thing to try to do for a robot but maybe it tries to build a hut or something if that can be done through self play it would learn a lot more quickly if somebody can figure that out and i think that would be something where it goes closer to kind of the mathematical leapfrogging where somebody figures out a formalism to say okay any rl problem by playing this and this idea you can turn it into a self play problem where you get signal a lot more easily reality is many problems we dont know how to turn into self play and so either we need to provide detailed reward that doesnt just reward for achieving a goal but rewards for making progress and that becomes time consuming and once youre starting to do that lets say you want a robot to do something you need to give all this detailed reward well why not just give a demonstration because why not just show the robot and now the question is how do you show the robot one way to show is to tally operate the robot and then the robot really experiences things and thats nice because thats really high signal to noise ratio data and weve done a lot of that and you teach your robot skills in just 10 minutes you can teach your robot a new basic skill like okay pick up the bottle place it somewhere else thats a skill no matter where the bottle starts maybe it always goes onto a target or something thats fairly easy to teach your robot with tally up now whats even more interesting if you can now teach your robot through third person learning where the robot watches you do something and doesnt experience it but just kind of watches you it doesnt experience it but just watches it and says okay well if youre showing me that that means i should be doing this and im not gonna be using your hand because i dont get to control your hand but im gonna use my hand i do that mapping and so thats where i think one of the big breakthroughs has happened this year this was led by chelsea finn here its almost like learning a machine translation for demonstrations where you have a human demonstration and the robot learns to translate it into what it means for the robot to do it and that was a meta learning formulation learn from one to get the other and that i think opens up a lot of opportunities to learn a lot more quickly so my focus is on autonomous vehicles do you think this approach of third person watching the autonomous driving is amenable to this kind of approach so for autonomous driving i would say third person is slightly easier and the reason im gonna say its slightly easier to do with third person is because the car dynamics are very well understood so the easier than first person you mean or easier than so i think the distinction between third person and first person is not a very important distinction for autonomous driving theyre very similar because the distinction is really about who turns the steering wheel or maybe let me put it differently how to get from a point where you are now to a point lets say a couple meters in front of you and thats a problem thats very well understood and thats the only distinction between third and first person there whereas with the robot manipulation interaction forces are very complex and its still a very different thing for autonomous driving i think there is still the question imitation versus rl so imitation gives you a lot more signal i think where imitation is lacking and needs some extra machinery is it doesnt in its normal format doesnt think about goals or objectives and of course there are versions of imitation learning and versus reinforcement learning type imitation learning which also thinks about goals i think then were getting much closer but i think its very hard to think of a fully reactive car generalizing well if it really doesnt have a notion of objectives to generalize well to the kind of general that you would want youd want more than just that reactivity that you get from just behavioral cloning slash supervised learning so a lot of the work whether its self play or even imitation learning would benefit significantly from simulation from effective simulation and youre doing a lot of stuff in the physical world and in simulation do you have hope for greater and greater power of simulation being boundless eventually to where most of what we need to operate in the physical world could be simulated to a degree thats directly transferable to the physical world or are we still very far away from that so i think we could even rephrase that question in some sense please and so the power of simulation right as simulators get better and better of course becomes stronger and we can learn more in simulation but theres also another version which is where you say the simulator doesnt even have to be that precise as long as its somewhat representative and instead of trying to get one simulator that is sufficiently precise to learn in and transfer really well to the real world im gonna build many simulators ensemble of simulators ensemble of simulators not any single one of them is sufficiently representative of the real world such that it would work if you train in there but if you train in all of them then there is something thats good in all of them the real world will just be another one of them thats not identical to any one of them but just another one of them another sample from the distribution of simulators exactly we do live in a simulation so this is just one other one im not sure about that but yeah its definitely a very advanced simulator if it is yeah its a pretty good one ive talked to stuart russell its something you think about a little bit too of course youre really trying to build these systems but do you think about the future of ai a lot of people have concern about safety how do you think about ai safety as you build robots that are operating in the physical world what is yeah how do you approach this problem in an engineering kind of way in a systematic way so when a robot is doing things you kind of have a few notions of safety to worry about one is that the robot is physically strong and of course could do a lot of damage same for cars which we can think of as robots too in some way and this could be completely unintentional so it could be not the kind of longterm ai safety concerns that okay ai is smarter than us and now what do we do but it could be just very practical okay this robot if it makes a mistake what are the results going to be of course simulation comes in a lot there to test in simulation its a difficult question and im always wondering like i always wonder lets say you look at lets go back to driving because a lot of people know driving well of course what do we do to test somebody for driving right get a drivers license what do they really do i mean you fill out some tests and then you drive and i mean its suburban california that driving test is just you drive around the block pull over you do a stop sign successfully and then you pull over again and youre pretty much done and youre like okay if a self driving car did that would you trust it that it can drive and id be like no thats not enough for me to trust it but somehow for humans weve figured out that somebody being able to do that is representative of them being able to do a lot of other things and so i think somehow for humans we figured out representative tests of what it means if you can do this what you can really do of course testing humans humans dont wanna be tested at all times self driving cars or robots could be tested more often probably you can have replicas that get tested that are known to be identical because they use the same neural net and so forth but still i feel like we dont have this kind of unit tests or proper tests for robots and i think theres something very interesting to be thought about there especially as you update things your software improves you have a better self driving car suite you update it how do you know its indeed more capable on everything than what you had before that you didnt have any bad things creep into it so i think thats a very interesting direction of research that there is no real solution yet except that somehow for humans we do because we say okay you have a driving test you passed you can go on the road now and humans have accidents every like a million or 10 million miles something pretty phenomenal compared to that short test that is being done so let me ask youve mentioned that andrew ng by example showed you the value of kindness do you think the space of policies good policies for humans and for ai is populated by policies that with kindness or ones that are the opposite exploitation even evil so if you just look at the sea of policies we operate under as human beings or if ai system had to operate in this real world do you think its really easy to find policies that are full of kindness like we naturally fall into them or is it like a very hard optimization problem i mean there is kind of two optimizations happening for humans right so for humans theres kind of the very long term optimization which evolution has done for us and were kind of predisposed to like certain things and thats in some sense what makes our learning easier because i mean we know things like pain and hunger and thirst and the fact that we know about those is not something that we were taught thats kind of innate when were hungry were unhappy when were thirsty were unhappy when we have pain were unhappy and ultimately evolution built that into us to think about those things and so i think there is a notion that it seems somehow humans evolved in general to prefer to get along in some ways but at the same time also to be very territorial and kind of centric to their own tribe like it seems like thats the kind of space we converged onto i mean im not an expert in anthropology but it seems like were very kind of good within our own tribe but need to be taught to be nice to other tribes well if you look at steven pinker he highlights this pretty nicely in better angels of our nature where he talks about violence decreasing over time consistently so whatever tension whatever teams we pick it seems that the long arc of history goes towards us getting along more and more so i hope so so do you think that do you think its possible to teach rl based robots this kind of kindness this kind of ability to interact with humans this kind of policy even to let me ask a fun one do you think its possible to teach rl based robot to love a human being and to inspire that human to love the robot back so to like rl based algorithm that leads to a happy marriage thats an interesting question maybe ill answer it with another question right because i mean but ill come back to it so another question you can have is okay i mean how close does some peoples happiness get from interacting with just a really nice dog like i mean dogs you come home thats what dogs do they greet you theyre excited makes you happy when you come home to your dog youre just like okay this is exciting theyre always happy when im here and if they dont greet you cause maybe whatever your partner took them on a trip or something you might not be nearly as happy when you get home right and so the kind of it seems like the level of reasoning a dog has is pretty sophisticated but then its still not yet at the level of human reasoning and so it seems like we dont even need to achieve human level reasoning to get like very strong affection with humans and so my thinking is why not right why couldnt with an ai couldnt we achieve the kind of level of affection that humans feel among each other or with friendly animals and so forth so question is it a good thing for us or not thats another thing right because i mean but i dont see why not why not yeah so elon musk says love is the answer maybe he should say love is the objective function and then rl is the answer right well maybe oh peter thank you so much i dont want to take up more of your time thank you so much for talking today well thanks for coming by great to have you visit']\n"

              "'the following is a conversation with brian armstrong cofounder and ceo of coinbase the largest cryptocurrency exchange platform with 98 million users in 100 countries listing bitcoin ethereum cardano and over 100 popular cryptocurrencies i recorded this conversation with brian before this weeks sec probe into whether some of the crypto listings are securities and thus need to be regulated as such as always with conversations that involve cryptocurrency i try to make it timeless so that the price soaring high or crashing down low doesnt distract from the fundamental technological economic social and philosophical ideas underlying this new form of money energy and information our world runs on money the exchange and store of value and cryptocurrency seeks to build the next chapter of how money works and what it can do coinbase and brian are trying to do this by working together with regulators and governments which is a long and difficult road bureaucracies resist change for better and for worse the latest sec probe is a good representation of this it is a serious attempt to limit fraud but one that also runs the risk of limiting innovation and limiting financial freedom of individuals this is a complicated mess and i applaud everyone involved for trying to work through it i hope in the end the interest of the individual wins decentralization after all is a hedge against the corrupting nature of centralized power this is the lex friedman podcast to support it please check out our sponsors in the description and now dear friends heres brian armstrong lets start with the fact that youre a programmer what was the first program youve ever written or the first one that you remember the first memory i have of programming was probably in middle school and i remember it was recess and they had this time period where you could read books and the other kids were reading comic books and stuff and for some reason i had gotten into this idea that i wanted to get into computers and i was playing with computers at home and so i got this book i think from the library it was called how to learn java in 30 days so i was reading this book at the recess and i didnt understand anything and i remember i went home and i tried to get this thing working and if youve ever written a java program the first lines are public static void main string args or whatever and its so foreign and its so difficult to get started and so i was kind of frustrated i was like i dont understand anything thats happening in this book so the first thing i wrote was probably just a hello world app in java but i felt like i was so confused about what was actually happening that i later learned a bit of php and php was like more fun for me because it was like oh just print out what you want it didnt have all this complexity around it so then i got more into php i started building like some simple websites i think learned some html so i think that was my introduction to programming at least the very beginning part yeah you know java has a lot of out of all the hello worlds it could possibly write java is the one where i think its the longest yeah which is quite interesting because java is often at least for a long time was used as the primary programming language to teach people how to program or at least about object oriented programming i think most universities have now switched and high school switched to python im not sure if thats the case probably better its easier to learn it lowers the it makes it less scary it was like less of a hurdle and certainly none of them use php i love php and i feel like its a dirty secret i have to keep private to myself like its somebody im seeing on the side or something like that because its just not a respected programming language because i think theres so many ways you can write poor code with php which is why its not respected yeah its a scripting language more so although of course facebook built like a huge stack on top of an invaluable company but i still love ruby to this day ruby is probably my favorite language pythons great too but i just love the idea behind ruby that its like lets make it easier for the human harder for the computer and make it a joy to be expressive and all these things so i was never the best computer scientist but i was a good hacker i could rapidly prototype products and using languages like ruby do a lot of computer science programs still use like lisp and scheme and things like that no they do for thats like thats if youre hardcore if youre legit youre gonna do some of the functional languages i think theres a few others that popped up but lisp is a distant memory for a lot of people thats like somebody has to like you go to library you dust off the book but scheme a little bit i think if youre starting i mean theres courses about languages themselves like programming languages lisp might be one of those you know how theres languages that nobody uses anymore like ancient languages you might have to go to school in that same way for programming languages back in the day we used to use parentheses i of course still use emacs as the editor for most things that i do and emacs is a lot of the customization you can do is in lisp and thats the language probably when i first really fell in love with programming is lisp because for a long time throughout the earlier history of artificial intelligence lisp was the primary language but it still had a life in the 90s and the aughts where some people would use it its such a beautiful functional language but it just somehow didnt pick up that said i should say sort of push back php i feel like its still true that most of the web runs on php most of the backend is still php so if you look at you know its like the stuff that people dont talk about its like what runs most systems in the world what runs the most backend what runs most front end javascript you know html the stack exchange surveys show javascript is the most popular language in the world i think right oh yeah in terms of programmers and numbers of i wonder by survey of number of programmers on stack overflow oh yeah but thats also the cutting edge right those are the people that are just like excitedly writing code i wonder if theres people that are just like maintaining gigantic code bases yeah i feel like the amount of java out there just running industrial systems has gotta be enormous and then of course in the banking industry finance its like even older stuff cobalt and whatnot but ive been actually looking for somebody to interview who represents cobalt and fortran like whos the figure still there that holds the flag i did you know with java founder of java creator of java creator of python creator of c but nobody wants to hold the flag for cobalt and fortran even though some of the most important systems in the world still run on those like power systems and infrastructure systems which is fascinating and atms and stuff like that like a lot of stuff that we rely on it just works and the reason we dont change it is because it works well it was written in languages that people dont use anymore yeah thatd be a cool series of interviews get the stuff thats like tech that was invented 40 50 years ago but still is being used widely i mean emacs is an example of that let me ask the big question of what are cryptocurrency exchanges and whats coinbase how does it work before ill ask even bigger questions but its just a nice kind of palate cleansing question of what is coinbase coinbase is a cryptocurrency exchange brokerage custodian basically were the primary financial account for people in the crypto economy how they buy crypto how they store it how they use it increasingly in different ways we can talk about that so yeah we want to be the way that a billion people hopefully access the open financial system globally how does it work whats cryptocurrency theres bitcoin theres ethereum what does it mean to be an exchange what does it mean to store what does it mean to transact how does it what does coinbase actually do okay so basically in any given market theres some people who want to buy some people who want to sell and you keep an order book of all those prices and then if someones willing to buy for more than the lowest price someones willing to sell then you get a trade to execute thats kind of how an exchange works underneath and a brokerage is kind of simpler than that even you dont have to know look at the whole order book and everything but you just go in there and you say i want to buy a hundred dollars of bitcoin or whatever cryptocurrency you get a quote and if you like it you can hit accept and the core things that we do to make all that kind of just work make it seamless it sounds simple on the surface is we have to do payment integrations in a variety of places around the world to make it easy for people to get fiat currency into this ecosystem we have to do work on cybersecurity a lot theres lots of hackers out there trying to break into our systems and steal crypto or to put stolen credit cards and bank accounts and things like that into these systems we have to integrate with the blockchains themselves which are periodically getting updated and having various airdrops and all kinds of things so were integrated with lots of different blockchains and then we have to store the crypto that people buy securely as well so crypto is kind of like storing you store the private keys essentially and weve invented a lot of cool technology about how to do that securely that helps me sleep at night as one of the largest crypto custodians out there so those are some of the pieces that had to come together to get that early simple buy sell experience to work and yeah i mean coinbase actually has a lot of different products now so we have like an institutional product we have coinbase commerce which is like merchant payments like stripe for crypto weve got a self custodial wallet which we can talk about theres all kinds of cool applications people are building with web3 and they can access it through that we just launched an nft product i can go on down the list so were sort of like a portfolio of crypto products now were big enough where we can do multiple things but yeah the core thing we got started with and still the majority of our revenue today is people just wanna come in and buy and sell some crypto and we help them do that and make it simple and easy to use and ill ask you about wallet nft is about what is it called the stripe type coinbase commerce coinbase commerce ill ask you about all that but order books in exchange whats the difference between that and stocks for example which theres also order books yes i mean stocks trade through order books too so do commodities theres all similar type of situation so when i wanna buy one bitcoin and i see coinbase say the price of that bitcoin is say 40000 and i press buy what happens yeah okay so youve gotten a lot when you press the button on your keyboard like an electrical signal goes up the wire on your keyboard no we wont cut out the level thats also important the timing right cause its not price fixed yeah thats true its giving you a quote right theres a whole concept of like slippage and like by the time the quote is executed if the price has moved too much like we may reject it and theres various things like that but how do i mean whats the simple version i can give you so well basically check the order book give you a quote its good for some period of time or for some amount of slippage and then whats happening is were initiating a debit to your payment method whether thats a credit card or a bank account or youre storing dollars or euros or something on our platform theres various payment methods so were basically debiting that and then were crediting you the crypto and were taking a fee for it too so thats fundamentally whats happening underneath and then theres just some interesting slippage how do you calculate how much slippage is allowed like how do you know these things cause order books are fascinating the dynamics of that is pretty interesting the little i know about it yeah so theres a lot of people like traders who get super into this and like high frequency traders and arbitrage and all kinds of interesting topics flash boys was like an interesting book on this whole thing you want like access to information the fastest sometimes even putting your thing in the data center right next to the thing we dont allow that colo stuff cause we want it to be more democratized but basically you give a lets say we wanted to just keep it math simple we want to charge a 1 fee so if youre buying 100 of bitcoin and well charge you 101 weve presented you the amount of bitcoin youre going to get for the 100 now lets say 10 seconds later you hit accept we go to fill the order so its going to be some error bound around that 1 fee right and if we think were actually losing money on the trade i think well often reject it so some part of the fee the slippage is incorporated into that averaged over a large number of people just its fascinating cause like even just like that little detail probably requires a lot of experimentation yeah and its kind of like a giant bug bounty out there because if you get it wrong theres people who are going to arbitrage that and weve had people sort of pen test our systems in a really creative ways where like theyll just fire like programmatically with apis theyll fire off like a million different quotes and look for one of them thats out of bounds and then actually take that money right there and we get people doing all kinds of crazy stuff so how do you protect against that how do you protect so well talk about cybersecurity in interesting ways but theres a lot of clever people trying to do clever things to earn not even just to break into the system but to earn an edge of some kind in the system how do you stay one step ahead theres no silver bullet its a bunch of lead bullets right so its like you know one thing we do is we just have good test suites right so youre testing every piece of code that goes out thats like just common good best practice but its particularly important in financial services another thing we do is we hire third party firms to try to audit this stuff and break in another one we do is we have a bug bounty program so we basically pay white hat hackers to find this stuff before the black hats do and weve paid out lots of good bug bounties so you know try all the above and occasionally you dont get it right and you lose some money and then you fix it and you keep going so yeah lets talk about cybersecurity a little bit more you mentioned using stolen bank accounts so thats another one thats another interesting one how do you protect against that okay so fraud prevention yeah is a big topic so one of the theres a lot of things people do but one of the things they do is that you use machine learning right so you look at hundreds to protect or to attack to protect against it so what you want to do is kind of build up a labeled data set of all the different people who have turned out to be fraudulent and good actors and hopefully collect as much data as you can and then you know you might feed hundreds or thousands of these factors into your machine learning model and itll come back with a risk score so you know an example of like the kinds of factors people create or put in there you know obviously i dont want to disclose too many of them because its a cat and mouse game but just kind of i dont know relatively well known stuff might be you know you have device fingerprints right so like what kind of device are you on and what fonts do you have installed a lot of people who are farming lots of these accounts theyre using emulators and like virtual machines and stuff theyre not like you know an average person on that device and then youll see sometimes like one of my favorite metrics we track for this was called like improbable travel velocity so we would were tracking peoples ips right and you might see someone who was one day in austin texas and then like an hour later they were in london or something its like well thats very improbable i mean sometimes people are using vpns so you gotta be careful with that because like theres legitimate people who use vpns too but if its not possible for them to have gotten on a plane and gotten there that quickly then thats usually theyre like spoofing a device or ip sometimes those are interesting factors but yeah if you feed enough of these in you will oh another fun one is like you know real users will type their credit card like one number at a time scammers have a list of them and theyll just paste in a whole number so you can look at like the number of milliseconds between keystrokes like theres all kinds of stuff people have come up with and even for travel velocity you could probably incorporate vpns too because theres probably a travel velocity for vpn switching too thats human like like if youre using legitimately vpn for something else that might be theres like legitimate uses too actually you know i feel embarrassed that i dont know this probably should but the im not a robot capture thing capture thing yeah so that probably works in the same way like how do you move your mouse maybe or how the dynamics of the clicking totally but how does that even work that well then and why cant it be fake i need to look into this cause its such a trivial capture it feels like it should be very crackable and yet a lot of high security places use that yeah its really interesting its another cat and mouse game so i think theyve yeah but its using a lot of similar signals like mouse movements keystrokes and then obviously all the stuff that comes over the wire with your browser so like what operating system what fonts what headers are being sent over and theres actually theres an old website i cant remember what its called it was kind of like panoptik click or panopticon or something but it basically was like a proof of concept site that they would just show you all the data that was kind of getting sent over with your request and like say that theres only one person in the world who has this exact set of data its you and so its almost like a workaround a clever workaround to track somebody make identify a unique person even if like there wasnt a cookie involved or something yeah this is a fascinating world where you cant see anybody here in the dark and yet you have a lot of signal and you have to figure out whos a real person whos not whos a robot whos not let me step back were gonna jump around all over the place let me step back thats why i like your interviews you get into like technical topics so just lets use bitcoin as a measure of time you started coinbase when bitcoin was 10 and you just mentioned an incredible system with security with transactions everything is thought through theres a lot going on but what was version one back in those early days the first prototype of coinbase what did that look like like what did it take to write it to think through it and make it work enough to at least make you believe that its gonna work well i definitely didnt know if it was gonna work i mean it was kind of i felt like i was just following my gut so i mean i was working at airbnb i was a software engineer there project manager i was working on some fraud prevention stuff for instance and i read the bitcoin white paper in kind of december of 2010 i started going to some bitcoin meetups in the bay area not only with bitcoin which is kind of like this new reserve currency but also with stable coins right which are new inventions there so yeah i basically feel like crypto is this secret hiding in plain sight that can create economic freedom for people all over the world and a more fair and free and global economy well so the limit and by the way i didnt know about argentina whyd you end up in argentina okay so i was basically i was living in houston texas after college where i went to school and i had never studied abroad i kind of like i dont know i felt like i needed some adventure or something in my life and i was like i was running this other startup that i was trying at the time a tutoring company and i could work from anywhere so my plan was you know what im just gonna go do like a month in every city around south america just like almost like to force myself out of my comfort zone because i had never traveled by myself to a foreign country or whatever and where i didnt really speak the language and anyway i landed in buenos aires thinking id go all around south america where i had never been there but i basically once i was set up in buenos aires with an apartment and a cell phone and stuff then i was like i dont wanna do that all again next month so i just stayed there for most of the time and took some day trips but yeah it was kind of a formative experience in that regard you got a chance sort of unexpectedly to experience the social effects of hyperinflation which is interesting but i also ive never been i really really wanna go as a person who likes tangos a person who likes the argentinian national team and soccer and steak all right and all the other things that argentina is known for okay so economic freedom one of the limits on economic freedom comes from government and government regulations and all those kinds of things throughout the world so how does cryptocurrency help resist that so can you sort of elaborate a little bit further what are the things that limit economic freedom and how does crypto help ease that today the world like the traditional financial system is basically every country of the world for the most part has their own currency and so theres a group of people or institutions in each of those countries thats controlling that economic policy or that money supply and it can be manipulated right so its not like many of these currencies are not linked to gold standard the us kind of famously came off that in 1970s for instance but if you read ray dalio and all this stuff like he talks about theres thousands of fiat currencies that have been in existence over time and basically all of them eventually get disconnected from backing of like hard commodities and then they get overinflated and printed and so in times of stress with nixon i guess it was like in the us it was the vietnam war or something like that it kind of drove government spending and so under times of stress they say hey its a temporary measure we need to break the peg temporary was like famous words that he used and they go print and so the bad thing about that of course is that it sort of erodes peoples like wealth if they can only hold their assets in cash which basically like poor people tend to do that if youre wealthy you can hold stocks or like real estate and things like that but its really a tax on the poorest people in society inflation so anyway crypto in a way is a little bit of like a return to the gold standard in this digital era right bitcoin theres guaranteed scarcity of it its deflationary theres never gonna be more than 21 million bitcoin and so thats a really important principle i also think not just bitcoin but like cryptocurrency generally its really important in terms of this you asked about regulation right so think about like if you wanted to make a global borrowing and lending marketplace or a global exchange you would have to go to all 200 countries in the world sometimes like maybe 50 states in the us and get lending licenses or an operating exchange or whatever and thats just an incredible amount of work and you cant even do business in many of these countries because like you have to bribe somebody or its corrupt or whatever and so but with defi with decentralized finance people have published like uniswap as a decentralized exchange everybody in the world no matter what country youre in what jurisdiction can interface with that decentralized exchange and theres no central company operating it its a smart contract on the ethereum blockchain which is globally decentralized so theres no throat to choke theres no one person or a company you can go to to like hey shut this thing down even if everybody whos working on uniswap today stopped the uniswap smart contract would continue to operate on the ethereum blockchain similarly for like a borrowing and lending marketplace like somebody in india wants to borrow from somebody in the us or whatever theres very difficult to do that in the traditional financial world but in a smart contract thats decentralized you can enable anybody to access it so its really kind of this great democratizing force that is creating a new financial system that is more fair and more free yeah and in some ways its a clever way thats enabling people to do that in a novel way so is uniswap in some sense a competitive coinbase in which way is it and which way is it not so because for people who dont know coinbase is centralized so let me ask doesnt that go against the spirit of crypto since crypto is decentralized what are the pros and cons of being centralized as an exchange so i dont think coinbase is fully centralized we have many different products and the way that i think about it is that our exchange or our brokerage is a centralized regulated financial service business and its actually important for the crypto ecosystem to have that because you wanna allow a lot of the fiat money in the world to flow into the crypto economy so were very proud of that and i think weve helped a lot of that money flow in now once people have money in crypto they can choose to hold it in a variety of ways and they can choose to hold it in a self custodial wallet which is more decentralized they can choose to use decentralized exchanges which we love and uniswap is not really i dont think of them as like a direct competitor to us we basically have integrated uniswap into a number of our products we love defi decentralized exchanges the whole thing so coinbase wallet which is a self custodial wallet is more decentralized and it allows people to hold their own crypto they dont have to trust us can you explain what a self custodial wallet is what is a wallet and what is a self custodial wallet yeah so its confusing so a custodial wallet means youre trusting coinbase to store your crypto the private keys themselves and for some people and institutions and everything just meeting them where they are today thats nice because its simpler theyre not afraid of losing their crypto if they make some accidental mistake or so custodial crypto products are important to help get a bunch of people into the ecosystem but im very supportive of self custodial wallets and i think in some ways they are the future because more and more people are gonna want to store their own crypto not trust a third party institution to do it and in some ways that is much more authentic to the ethos of crypto so coinbase will help you convert the fiat into crypto and frankly thats a more centralized thing but once you have crypto you can then go to the self custodial world store it yourself and to get into the technical details just for a second its basically saying youre gonna store the keys on your own device and so even if coinbase gets some court order to seize it we actually cant from an architecture point of view we cant do it or if coinbase gets hacked or something we cant lose your funds now the thing is you have to take the responsibility because were not taking it so the individual person could get hacked and theres a whole bunch of really cool research happening to make self custodial wallets more resilient to accidental loss hacks and just user error i dont know how much youve looked at various cryptography things but basically you can have multiple signatures from different keys on different devices where you need two of the three or three of the five theres a whole technology called multi party computation or threshold signing signatures which is really cool but those are the things you would run locally these are all security measures cryptography measures to protect you without a centralized component right so a simple example would be lets say you had a two of three key signature and one key might be stored at coinbase but thats not a quorum so we couldnt unilaterally move your funds but another key is on your device on your phone lets say oh cool so in a normal situation you have a key on your phone we have one and so two out of three it can all get signed very quickly for day to day use but lets say you lose your phone or something now there has to be a third key and thats where you could store it in a backup somewhere like in google drive or icloud you could trust a third party thats not coinbase to also have that one key and they cant do anything unilaterally with that one key so thats a simple example you can get way more complicated yeah thats an awesome idea so if your funds get seized coinbase cant do anything but you better not lose your phone maybe in that case yeah yeah but it provides a there is so even if you lose your phone then there is a recovery mechanism because you can get the one key from coinbase the one from your backup provider and recover a new one back on your phone i know yeah but what if coinbase is no longer but because of government because of say its in north korea government says youre no longer like coinbase is shut down in that country or something like that then you can get it even if you have access to those two so again perhaps a silly question but isnt a self custodial wallet a competitor as a notion to coinbase no i mean so we offer a self custodial wallet weve built one and its like one but doesnt it bleed the like i guess im asking a sort of a financial question is like how does coinbase make money on transactions so does this not it does not decrease the number or does not significantly negatively affect transactions or are you more focused on growing the number of the pie of the number of people that are using cryptocurrency yeah like a traditional financial service firm would probably say well we should be storing lets keep more of the custody with us because thats how we prove to the world that were valuable or whatever i dont really believe that like i think that actually we kind of want to encourage our users to move to self custody over time for those who are ready and willing and that technology needs to mature im not trying to like force anybody to do it who doesnt want to do it but to me thats like the future of how we get billions of people using crypto but doesnt that mean they can go somewhere else easier yeah thats sort of the point is like were all using the same protocol so theres low switching costs which keeps all the companies accountable right like if you want to access the visa network theres only one company in the world you can go through to do that like visa but if you want to access the bitcoin network theres dozens or hundreds of companies out there who can do that so its arguably you could argue its worse for us as a company but i think its better for its what makes bitcoin interesting and cryptocurrency interesting is that nobody controls it there is low switching costs for customers its better for customers and that means that all the companies in the space are going to be held to a high standard because the minute you lose someones trust theyre just going to move their bitcoin to some other service and thats good for the world do you think of coinbase as so theres these ideas of layer one layer two layer three technologies do you think of coinbase as layer one layer two layer three now that said theres so many products that are under the coinbase umbrella that its hard to answer that question but what do you think do you acknowledge the existence of layer three so you know usually when people are using those terms layer one layer two so theyre referring to like layer one would be the blockchain layer one blockchain itself like a bitcoin or ethereum or something not like a centralized service like coinbase or even our decentralized self custodial wallet so yeah i wouldnt consider us to be like a layer one these are the decentralized protocols that were integrating but coinbase itself is not those yes but layer two is the thing that was basically doing transactions without the settlement on the blockchain and so you get to have some of the benefits of faster transactions without the security associated with the blockchain and layer three is i suppose sort of apps built on top of that so you know at least i think talking to michael saylor he considers coinbase a layer three technology interesting okay im not really particularly familiar with this kind of distinction of layer three and two i dont see them as fundamentally different but some of the okay i mean one way of asking that is there some layer two like of magic happening in order to make transactions associated with the blockchain happen instant so that theyre quick so that on coinbase on coinbase yeah is there some magic going on because youre okay we should say how many cryptocurrencies are currently on coinbase so its more than two yeah its a lot more than two yeah so you have to understand they have to incorporate all these technologies yeah so how do you make that magic of sort of universal transactions happen across all of these different cryptocurrencies theres our centralized products and decentralized products right the centralized products we are storing that crypto for you and so if youre moving from one of your accounts to another account like an eth1 account to eth2 account or from my eth coinbase centralized account to your eth centralized so we can do that transaction off chain to make it faster and it saves the customer fees and it just confirms instantly but its not truly using the decentralized blockchain right so you can also send any bitcoin address or ethereum address for instance and that is putting the transaction on chain now our decentralized products like coinbase wallet the self custodial wallet every transaction is happening on chain with that and so basically it just shows a little bit of the evolution of coinbase and the blockchains themselves like in the early days these networks were not scalable and so there were no l2 solutions for instance and so we had to do sort of these hacks like moving the crypto off chain if you were moving between your own accounts and stuff like that otherwise the minor fees would have just eaten us alive as a company right yeah but now the blockchains are starting to scale theres a whole bunch of more work that needs to be done on that and were getting l2 solutions so i think more and more of the transactions are going on chain whether its l2 l1 and ideally we shouldnt be doing that many transactions off chain just internal coinbase ledger or something thats not really in the spirit of crypto so when you say on chain that includes layer two technology that the blockchain proposes yeah i guess i was asking how much fun magic is happening off chain within coinbase and youre saying in the early days you had to but youre trying to do less and less so look theres a bunch of high frequency traders that use the centralized products and even just regular retail people they dont want to pay the gas fees and stuff and theyre trying to it actually we back at the envelope calculated this out at one point and just like it would be completely infeasible for like high frequency traders to put everything on chain at this point thats basically what dexs are doing and so both are important i think more and more is going to move decentralized over time which is great and were and were basically dexs are decentralized exchanges by the way yeah so anyway we want to encourage more and more of it to move decentralized over time but i dont the centralized things arent going away for like a long time its a decade from now theres going to be some big institution or pension fund or central bank thats like all right we got to hold crypto lets set up the account in a centralized way so thats thats fine both both are important do you know the number of cryptocurrencies currently on coinbase do you know that number its over a hundred but it depends it depends what jurisdiction youre in and you know are you in institution versus retail theres like theres so many different categories now but over a hundred yeah so what does it take to become to to to become an asset to become a cryptocurrency on coinbase to add your technology to coinbase okay well so were trying to get away from this idea of being listed on coinbase as being seen as like an endorsement or something because i actually think its very important that we are not considered judge and jury about you know like imagine it was the early days of the internet and you were like whats a good webpage and whats a bad webpage like you would have been totally wrong or anytime big tech companies try to make these review review boards of like you know apple famously gets in trouble for this a lot with their app store review process right and so something that you think like a committee of people somewhere thinks looks silly may turn out to be the next big thing right and so its very difficult so what do we do we basically have a test of legality right we check you know do we believe this is a security if so it cant be listed on coinbase and theres a very rigorous process we go through for that just currently the way the laws are in the us you cant do that and weve been we acquired a broker duo license from the sec were trying to work with them to get that operational and hopefully someday we can trade real crypto securities but today thats not possible in the us at least then we look at sort of the cybersecurity of the crypto asset does it do we see that theres some flaw in the smart contract or you know a way that somebody could manipulate it without the customers permission we look at some compliance pieces to it as well like the actors behind it and like you know there any kind of criminal history anything like that but if we believe it meets our listing standards basically this test of legality and everything for customer protection then we want to list it because we want the market to at that point decide and its kind of like amazon or something like that where you know a product might have three stars or it might have five stars but if it starts to get one star consistently like its probably a fraudulent or its defective or something like maybe amazon will remove it but otherwise you want to let the market decide what these things are so thats generally how we do it and by the way more and more of these assets i think especially like low market cap assets are going to be traded on dexs through coinbase its not that we we dont need to list every asset on a centralized exchange i think dexs are really good for the long tail and then it becomes an even its even more clear to people like this is not some endorsement by a coinbase of like this assets good and this ones bad like you know my belief is theres going to be millions of these assets over time and so i hope it doesnt like make news every time we add one in the future basically yeah i wonder how you get there because i even i look to coinbase for for example you know people as you can imagine sort of tag me on twitter or something like that and all that like you should interview our sort of this the founder of this particular coin right yeah and i its so hard for me to know whats first of all whats interesting technology whats whos a scammer or not whos actually legitimately representing an ambitious new thing versus a scam and i you know theres very few sources of like a verification signal and unfortunately coinbase in part has become a little bit of that too and youre trying to get away from that because youre trying to get as many sort of let the people decide so youre thinking of like amazon star type system where the people could rate yeah so i think well actually probably add like user ratings and reviews so and well be very cautious about like you know these are real people theres a bunch of stuff we have to do for that already so i think wisdom of the crowds is good in terms of getting feedback on items but we also were gonna do our own review which i mentioned earlier right which is like okay it meets this minimum bar to be listed on our site yeah i think yeah both are important how do you know if a coin is a scam or not well you can see a few things so you know i hate to use the word scam because a lot of these are judgment calls you gotta i kind of a court may or a jury may land either way but things that would be red flags to look at would be you know is a bunch of the asset owned by an insider or insiders with short vesting periods you know does the background of the founders like they may have criminal records or if theyve perpetrated other frauds in the past right theres a difference between something which is just a me too product its like it doesnt have anything interesting about it and something thats an actual fraud or outright scam and you have to a lot of this data whats cool about it is that its now available on chain you can look at like the tokenomics behind it and see who owns it and are they selling it you know in like inappropriately or are they pumping it on like youtube and twitter and making promises about hey the value of this thing may be a higher in the future and like all those are just big big no nos that we would you know we just dont wanna go there so our whole thing is like we want to enable innovation in this space but not allow anybody to curtail the advancement of this industry by like doing some kind of fraudulent thing or get rich quick thing so its a tricky industry because im trying to figure out who to you know whats interesting to understand to research and its hard to know let me ask you about a tricky one to add to a centralized exchange which is privacy preserving cryptocurrency so like monero yeah is that technically difficult or is that why why is like monero for example forget that specific one but like privacy preserving cryptocurrency blockchains why is that is that ever possible to add so thats a great question so the answer is maybe so heres the reason why so because were a regulated financial service business we have various licenses to do that we are regulated by various regulators part of those licenses requires us to have a quote reasonable program to monitor for suspicious activity you know an aml program anti money laundering right and so if it if a coin is a hundred percent anonymous and we cant really do blockchain analytics to track source of funds and where these things might be going it makes it harder to have a reasonable program around that thats defensible now there are privacy preserving coins like zcash which have something called a view key and a view key is basically another key which allows you to deanonymize the transactions in specific situations where you want that so for instance you know we do support zcash and one of the ways we got comfortable with that is that when youre buying it on coinbase you know you can basically have a view key the transactions are not anonymous while youre buying it and we can see where it goes afterwards and do our whole standard program now if it gets a few hops away down the road i mean people could eventually turn on privacy preserving aspects so you know these are tough judgment calls but at least in terms of our interaction with the customer and everything we feel comfortable at that i think theres a broader point here which is that i actually think privacy coins are a good thing for the world and they should be allowed and more like you know despite weve made this judgment call to operate in a regulated and safe and compliant way but just taking my coinbase hat off for a minute i think the world would be a better place if there were more privacy coins because its kind of like the internet when it first came online like there was no https everything was http and there was you know so people were afraid to put their credit cards on the internet and your messages could be intercepted and all this stuff and now the whole internet has basically moved to https with a little lock icon in your browser which is better like and financial information is like the most important information to keep private right so theres times where like lets say youre running a charity or something and you want to have total auditability transparency for the whole world who donated and where did the money go thats great you want it to be public but if its like your personal money or something like that you dont want to be broadcasting that to the whole world and in some ways thats what blockchains are doing you know pseudonymously because like but it is a public ledger and so if you can know who owns each address you can basically deanonymize it i you know i think basically people should fight for privacy and freedoms of all kinds but privacy of money is a good thing so i would like to see more of that in the future you chosen with coinbase to have a seat at the table with the regulators so what kind of conversations are there at that table what are the regulations like what is the level of understanding with regulators what are they worried about what are they thinking about what are the positive and what are the negative regulations that youre facing that youre educating struggling with pushing back on supporting all that kind of stuff yeah oh man theres so many cause were i mean were live in like you know maybe a hundred countries or more at this point so the conversations are all over the map im trying to think what broad strokes i could paint for you so id say one trend thats positive is that basically regulators around the world are more and more over the last five years i would say its more and more common to find a regulator today asking how can we preserve the innovation potential of this technology while keeping the bad actors out than it was five years ago where they were saying this is all bad activity how do we prevent it and so maybe this is when you say more and more what fraction ill give you like a us specific example although we operate in many countries so when i go to dc now i would say you know 50 60 of the people who i meet with are basically you know theyre in the camp of crypto has a lot of potential we should regulate it to make sure the bad people dont do something bad with it but this is here to stay and it has a lot of upside we should basically create the awful regulation and celebrate it and actually encourage this innovation to happen in the us thats a huge change from just three years ago where it was probably 30 of people saying that now its like 60 its like almost double its getting harder to find like true crypto skeptics in dc id say that you know maybe only like 20 or 30 of people are like willing to say something negative like they actually think its net negative its like its really hard to defend that position at this point because almost like one in five americans have used or tried crypto at this point so youre kind of condemning 20 of your fellow citizens if you say that at this point you know especially with nfts and all these things like a huge segment of people who dont even care about investing or whatever came into the space so and then basically thats that same conversation is happening but you know delayed by a few years in like india and europe and in some asian countries and some countries have really embraced crypto and theyre like trying to really theyre ahead of where the us is because theyre trying to actually attract the best startups and entrepreneurs like you know like dubai and uk and australia and all are kind of pushing good regulation el salvador actually i guess adopted it as like bitcoin as a legal tender there was another country central african republic i think that is supposedly did that as well but you know theres countries like china that are more autocratic that are saying hey this is a threat to our power and like were gonna try to really curtail it so what kind of regulations are there that you feel the most that are limiting or that are empowering like is there specific examples yeah okay so i mean basically i think the securities laws in the us need to be clarified about what crypto is many different things thats what people dont realize so like some crypto like bitcoin ethereum and many others are probably more like commodities theyre not controlled by any one person you know like anyway theres people who wanna raise money for a company thats sounds more like a security that should be regulated by the sec commodities are regulated by the cftc then theres some cryptocurrencies which are more like currencies like stable coins and central bank digital currencies and those are probably you know should be regulated by the treasury or someone like that and then theres a whole another category of cryptocurrencies which are none of those things theyre nfts like artwork or theyre metaverse items or decentralized identity and voting and so i think that theres a very unhelpful point of view out there by some folks which is hey this is all most of this is like bad activity we need to shut it down so were just gonna pursue enforcement actions or something like that most people in dc dont feel that way anymore and i think the people of the us dont feel that way anymore because a lot of them are using this stuff and their general view is theres a lot of upside potential here we can all agree lets get rid of the fraud and the scams we all wanna get rid of that so lets create a relatively simple test which says if its like nobody controls more than 20 of it or some threshold it probably is more like a commodity if someones raising money for theyre selling this thing for a business then its probably a security and then if its more like a medium of exchange its a currency and if its none of those things maybe its artwork or whatever a legal test like that would help clarify who which regulator is regulating what and then we also wanna have probably like a sandbox for innovation where if youre a startup and youre doing less than i dont know some number less than some amount of payment volume or customer funds youre storing its like just let those things get off the ground without a soul crushing amount of legal bills and uncertainty so if the us can get there that would be great i think a bunch of other countries now are rushing around the world to sort of create that regulation that does attract innovation and so in the international bodies like imf and g20 and stuff theyre starting to look at proposed regulation i hope that coinbase and a bunch of other crypto companies can help in that conversation too we have a whole policy effort i think actually crypto policy efforts are like probably one of the biggest things in dc right now so it moves slow at the speed of government but yeah and in the meantime were just trying to help more and more people use crypto because ultimately thats what in the democracies thats what they care about like theyll do what the people of the country want so you want governments to start understanding differences between in the crypto space commodities securities currencies nfts i still dont understand what are they supposed to make sense of nfts what is nfts exactly from a perspective of a regulator yeah so is it the other categories yeah most nfts you could think of as like artwork although its who knows where its gonna go it could be you mentioned metaverse right you mentioned some kind of unique identity of a thing yeah like theres people selling virtual land in nfts i actually i bought this nft thats like its like citizenship in this like city dow in wyoming like ive never been there but its almost like a badge or an attestation like to get access to this location theres like people doing like tickets to events like you know theyre called a poaps like proof of attendance and things like that so itll be very interesting to see where nfts go over time it could get and thats the danger you dont wanna try to like define the regulation if you dont even know where this things gonna go so and so your efforts in the policy arm is education yeah education advocacy were just trying to be like a helpful educational resource essentially and then if they give us feedback and theyre like hey dont do this or dont or do this like were more than happy to do anything thats requested we generally go get licenses and weve just tried to do the right thing in the absence of clarity because if its not clear what the law says then you should just basically do good things that you think may be required in the future to show good faith effort towards the right thing and thats part of like innovating in a regulated field which is you know a whole topic in itself so if you are at the table let me this is less the case in the united states but can government agencies seize a persons cryptocurrency by forcing coinbase to hand it over so when youre centralized they have a phone number to call okay so this is a complicated topic like if you really wanna be sure that this is why people wanna store their own crypto right like with self custodial wallets like with coinbase wallet embracing decentralization they wanna avoid that now in the us there is rule of law right so we have reasonable protections in place around like search and seizure and things like that you know coinbase does we publish transparency reports on this we get subpoenas court orders things like that from various countries around the world and there are situations where we have been ordered to freeze accounts things like that you know we have to follow the law is another way to put it were a regulated financial service business and so if the money is used as part of breaking the law thats what that in a particular jurisdiction in a particular right and then the other thing sometimes we will actually get court orders or subpoenas that are overly broad weve seen so they need to follow due process right and so weve seen some in the past that were like well we need you to freeze this huge number of accounts and its like well well actually have gone to court and like pushed back on some of these and said like what is your probable cause and has the threshold been met and like weve won some of those cases on behalf of our customers so yeah its actually really its kind of unfortunate and frustrating as a large business you spend a lot of resources basically interacting with inbound requests by all kinds of lawyers and people and requesting things and some of them are silly and ridiculous and you have to push back and say no and so its kind of a tax on every company at a certain size which ultimately gets passed on to the customer in higher fees so you have to employ armies of lawyers to deal with this stuff can you educate me on something how much innovation is there in the legal space so for lawyers working with coinbase because its such a new cutting edge thing so youre theres a lot of gray area youre supposed to be operating under like how hard is it being a lawyer at coinbase like how much precedence is there i guess is what im asking i mean just like you said three years its kind of a new space yeah well its probably very hard to be a lawyer at coinbase and very fun because whenever youre in a new field thats growing fast there isnt a lot of case law and just precedent set so thats also an opportunity for you to go create that stuff and thats what a lot of legal careers are made out of is like take a complex situation where you have to balance difficult things like how do we prevent bad activity but still enable an innovation thats a hard question and theres you can go draft legislation and circulate it to policymakers or come up with these policies and how do you operate a business in an environment where the law is just unclear right its like try to do the right thing but like strike the right balance so yeah a lot of our lawyers have to come up with that very creative stuff you mentioned one of the things youre focused on is expanding the number of people maybe a billion people on coinbase or using cryptocurrency where are we at now how do we get to a billion as of q4 last year we had 89 million verified accounts on coinbase but in any given quarter only maybe like 10 or a little more million of those are like really active so and then if you look at globally i think some of the estimates ive seen is maybe theres like 200 million people or something like that who have ever used or tried crypto so were a long you know were ways from a billion but its not like that far off how do you get there how do you get to a billion so a few things one is the blockchains have got to become way more scalable its kind of like were all running dial up modems and we need broadband and so its just like too expensive too slow to do all these transactions and i think if we just get l2s working and scalability you know well see another order of magnitude kind of come out just from that i think the second one would be more clear regulation that would help a lot i do talk to you know pension funds and you know various asset managers sovereign wealth funds and stuff and a lot of them tell me weve got 1 of our portfolio in crypto today but we really would rather have like 20 in there but what were waiting for is more clear regulation coming out and saying that clear test that i was saying these assets are commodities regulated by scpc these are by scc these are by treasury whatever so that would be a big unlock do transactions so one of the things that you mentioned payments sorry yeah well does that unlock a lot of users yeah it does i mean remittance is like a huge thing people sending money home to their families in other countries where the fees are super high so yeah if we get blockchains to be more scalable and theres more global adoption like i think well see remittance quarters move over to crypto a lot theres also just the other thing thats driving a lot of crypto adoption is basically the creation of more and more third party apps so or dapps theyre sometimes called decentralized dapps so a lot of startups now you know how like you used to use in the early 2000s they called themcom startups but now you dont need to saycom cause everybodys using the internet and so now theres like hundreds or thousands of these crypto startups but i think in the future you wont need to call them crypto startups cause theyll just be called startups cause everyones using the internet and crypto and whatever so anyway the use cases the utility of crypto is getting better and better with like all these third party apps getting funded and created and do you think theres going to be a killer or a set of killer dapps like a thing where nobody can live without are we still waiting for that theres going to be a bunch of them its just like its like the internet like what were the killer web companies you know like uber and wikipedia and airbnb and google and like so theres going to be some big winners but therell be thousands of this is basically the new its like what happened with thecom startups in the early 2000s its like a lot of the best entrepreneurs are building crypto startups now so tons of venture money flowing into the space a lot of smart young people so do you think bitcoin or some other cryptocurrency will become the reserve currency of the world at some point cause this is kind of a controversial idea but i actually think yes i do think bitcoin could end up becoming a reserve currency of the world so ive been reading ray dalio recently with his new book like the changing world order and i thought it was a really well researched book he talks in there he looks back at history right he looks at like empires and going back to various chinese empires the dutch and ottomans and everybody and how did they rise and they were able to have the reserve currency as they rose and what produced that like it came from good education and innovation and better trade and anyway so the us by some measures is kind of looks like its maybe its had a really good run and its coming down a little bit and china is kind of coming up who knows how thatll play out by the way like the world is very complicated it could that could switch but i guess if the us dollar is gonna be seeing more inflation in the future the chinese yuan is not like necessarily better right i mean they have a ton of debt as well and its not like you could really that the yuan could be inflated as well right it probably will be and so i do think that theres this group of people today which probably most traditional i dont know like the people who run big banks and like governments and stuff that theyre not this is not really on their radar today but i think theres basically a group of younger people in that kind of 25 35 year old range who are tech savvy theyre starting to think of crypto as like the primary thing in their financial life its like i basically hold my wealth in crypto and i use dollars or euros or whatever if i happen to need something i convert it to that at the last minute its like if im traveling i might convert some local currency in the moment but thats not where i hold most of my wealth so this segment of the population is not like massive yet from a gdp point of view but i think its a leading indicator of where things could be going and this is actually good for the world its kind of like especially if china does continue to rise and it has a more authoritarian view itll be kind of this very centralized east versus a decentralized west where people are in the west in the free world really kind of embracing crypto and a more open fair free global financial system which i think will be enormously beneficial for humanity and i do think basically bitcoin is the reserve currency the gold standard of the crypto economy so thats pretty crazy yeah the gold standard i mean its also like with ray dalio i feel like china will drive a lot of this either in response or directly i mean i think the ruble im not paying as close attention to the financial systems but i think theyre trying to tie it to gold once again so thats an interesting maybe itll be one of the more authoritarian regime that will switch to bitcoin standard first and then its the west that will out of that pressure will catch up versus the other way around its fascinating to think of what is the forcing function what kind of perturbation is required to switch to change anything honestly about the financial system but it could be as youre saying just waiting for the people that are young now that are embracing crypto to enter the positions of power essentially but i hope thats not the case because if for any innovation we have to wait sorry to say for the older folk to pass away thats not an efficient way to make change yeah thats a super interesting topic of how peoples minds become less plastic as they age i guess its a feature its called wisdom but then we also need the wild ones to explore exploration versus exploitation you wrote a blog post thats really interesting in september 2020 titled coinbase is a mission focused company like what were talking about so one interesting thing you said in that blog post is that were not going to be distracted by activism within the company thats not related to the mission of the company now thats a rare thing for a company to state for a company ceo to state especially in this climate can you first of all describe in a little more detail what you meant did you receive blowback for this i definitely received some blowback but yeah ill describe what i meant and if you want to talk about how it came to that too we can talk about that but what i meant is that theres a lot of companies right now including tech companies but not exclusively where i think like great companies they have an important mission theyre trying to do something really good for the world and unfortunately theyre getting a little distracted from that at times because of employee activism that is causing the company to basically jump into whatever the current thing is and try to help is like the positive interpretation the negative interpretation would be to virtue signal and my view is that this is actually kind of destructive to this is largely an american company phenomenon by the way i do worry that this is making america less competitive even though i think of myself as kind of internationally minded but i am a us citizen had my whole life here so when we put out this statement we had employees that were not in the us who were confused by it they were like why did brian need to say that it was just saying youre going to focus on work at work thats what we were doing already and there was certain pockets of the us certain cities in particular where we had employees that a very peculiar cultural phenomenon had evolved where i think people really wanted the company they worked at to be almost acting like the government or something and like trying to solve the hardest societal issues and at least have an opinion on it if not contribute to the solution on almost everything and for me it was a very uncomfortable situation for me as a ceo id never quite been in this situation where most of the time when employees in the past were kind of asking me questions they would be asking about like how do we make this product better like what do we do with this competitor what about this regulator and it got to a place around that time where most of the questions we were receiving were i think even about things not related to the company they were about broader societal issues like brian whats your stance on xyz controversial thing and it was i often like didnt have an opinion on these really hard questions right and i didnt really i felt like it was distracting the company people internally were getting into fights a lot too like disagreeing with each other there was a thing where like the social slack internally was turning into a social media almost with people putting in flame wars so and this culminated by the way with a walkout that happened in the company we had received like some demands from employee groups about various things and there was like basically an antagonistic thing with management and employee and i was like were all on the same team here if you wanna be antagonistic lets do it with somebody else outside the company that were trying to improve the world in that dimension so yeah eventually i was like okay the company is not aligned on this i just dont feel i dont like the job as ceo frankly like if the job is to come in here every day and like have to squirm in front of like the most difficult societal questions i dont think i wanna do that job so like either theyre gonna have to go or im gonna have to go and i founded this company and i really believe in the mission so theyre gonna have to go and what i realized was that so i basically i made an exit package available to anybody who wasnt on board with this direction 5 of employees took it i got the company realigned towards this mission were all here to do work by the way people can they can go do anything like political or social activism outside of work its totally fine like we all everybody has stuff like that in their personal life but while at work we can also disagree at work by the way on the work you know this is not like a no disagreement culture like we should lets try to get the truth but dont bring stuff into work thats just gonna create division make the workplace a refuge from division about all these crazy things and like were all aligned here to work on the mission lets do that yeah that was really really really refreshing to hear so this is me speaking but theres a sense when companies take on these issues publicly from a ceo position or anywhere else that it does seem to optimize for virtue signaling versus solving a particular problem because to solve a particular problem you really have to really put in a huge you have to hire a huge number of you basically have to create a company with a company to take on a particular thing but if you allow yourself to internally care about a particular issue youre basically pacifying some number of employee like making sure slack doesnt get out of hand and then youre doing this kind of from my perspective especially on issues that care about fake virtue signaling basically trying to understand what will make me look the best what would make the company look the best in this particular aspect and it just seems very shallow and its optimizing for the wrong thing not for the solving of the problems but for the making yourself look like the good guy and trying to then leverage that to say im the good guy in all situations and it just its the wrong thing and perhaps from your perspective as a ceo as a leader its also creating division unnecessary division within people like they get yeah theres something about us who gets extremely argumentative about certain topics they really bring out the emotion and i think that probably as you were saying that emotion is even probably okay maybe productive when that emotion has to do with the mission of the company like you really care about those disagreements versus like something that has nothing to do with increasing economic freedom using crypto yeah its fascinating but it was so refreshing because its rare why do you think thats a rare so the city youre mentioning i mean theres a bunch of cities but san francisco is one such city when that culture and its sad because san francisco is also the bay area is also the hub historically of some of the greatest innovation in human history so theres that tension how did that culture emerge there where like the innovation was done by people that are very mission driven you get a bunch of smart people together to solve a difficult problem they get maybe sometimes too much blinders on but they try to balance that because it requires that focus to solve an actual problem and yet thats also the place where this culture emerged its a fascinating human dynamic i dont know somebody will one day tell the history of silicon valley not just the innovation but the social dynamics that occurred there anyway why do you think thats so rare well because people dont wanna get attacked its like super you dont wanna get canceled right its super uncomfortable nobody wants to be called a racist or whatever people wanna say on twitter did you get attacked yeah yeah i definitely got attacked i mean and i knew it would be controversial the only reason i did it frankly was that i was kind of at my wits end i was like well like i said earlier like the job the ceo job sucks like either i dont wanna do it or they have to go and im gonna make the company into something that i want and id spent eight or 90 years of my life at that point kind of building this thing i was like well i could go start another company but it takes a long time to get momentum with these things and coinbase is a very rare thing that happened in the world i feel very passionate about it so yeah im not gonna go like i need to make this the company that i wanna work at and what was really interesting was that there was such a huge outpouring of support so i knew that it would be controversial and i would get attacked and predictably there was some journalists and new york times and all these people who kind of like went and started writing hit pieces on the company shortly thereafter and they basically just call people whove left the company and can get quotes on whatever they want and then theyll write a story so mainstream media i lost a lot of trust in mainstream media frankly after that and of course its kind of become obvious since then that most mainstream media is like hyper politicized at this point its basically either super left or super right and its not really that focused on truth so thats kind of unfortunate because i think journalism is actually like really important in society so that whole thing got eroded in the us luckily theres sort of new media people like you and a whole bunch of people did that blog post help that statement the 95 people that remained is this still something you struggle with because its also a culture of the broader tech space okay so that was an interesting thing which was that so the 95 of people stayed i got a huge outpouring of support from people who said thank god you finally spoke up and said something because frankly it was making it not a very fun place to work either and i realized that there is i think there was i think nassim taleb has this blog post about the tyranny of the 1 or something like that but theres basically a relatively small group one in 5 or something like that that is really upset about something its not the majority of the company its like 5 theres another 15 or something that are sympathetic to the cause theyre actually somewhat suggestible they will go along with whatever because it sounds reasonable these are like real issues theyre talking about its not to say that its not real and theyll kind of get swept up in it but theres an 80 of the company that basically doesnt agree or just wants to get their work done without all this drama or distraction and theyre afraid to speak up because if they speak up theyre afraid of being again called a racist like fired ostracized amongst their peers and so it did require it to get to a bad enough place for me to finally say you know what i just i feel like i have to do this live through the short term attacks of the press which ultimately was very freeing for me because now i dont really care and now i can actually just build the company that i want to build without caring about that and then what was cool was a lot of really great people reached out to the coinbase too after that and were like im an early engineer at google or wherever and this culture has gotten kind of messed up and i want to work at a company thats willing to stand for that and so weve gotten a lot of good people come over basically what i realized and by the way our diversity numbers and all that stuff people told me when i was drafting this poster dont post this people underrepresented groups will never want to work at this company again and i was like i dont think thats true i talked to our erg groups and theyre not telling me they care about this stuff that much theyre telling me they just want to be respected at work and do good work and contribute so my gut was telling me that that advice was wrong and i can tell you a year after doing it our diversity numbers are basically either the same or better in every category so that turned out to be false look i hate to be polarizing on either dimension here i just want to get good work done and build good stuff with technology so i think companies should just have reasonable policies you want to get rid of bias in hiring you want to attract great people from all different backgrounds we have pledge 1 we put 1 of the company equity into a foundation i hope were able to do good stuff with that lets give back in some way but the main message i guess for me is the core mission the core work that were doing on economic freedom and just all of our products that is the main value that were contributing in the world lets just do that more and hopefully we can get from 89 million verified users to a billion or whatever and then i just think thats how well have the biggest impact its tempting though its so interesting how companies get tempted to help and you step in and its almost like a drug and then you cant you forget i mean like all of us in life just have to be companies you get distracted and maintaining focus youre absolutely right the way for coinbase to add value to the world is to maximize the mission that its on not other stuff and when you get wealthier and more successful it becomes more and more tempting to just help out in some other shallow ways its fascinating and you just kind of brought that to light so it was very refreshing and it shouldnt be controversial to sort of focus on just getting stuff done well let me ask you i mean do you think that this its all these things tie together theres like a general trend of like more censorship theres like more cancel culture theres some of these like freedom values are kind of even like freezing peoples accounts like the trucker thing that happened and this seems like theres a general trend of more authoritarian policies there but do you feel like the tide is turning on that like theres counter examples to it weve seen recently i think its the last gasp of old way of doing things and so theres desperation and so on because to be fair its kind of the internet which is wheres the source of a lot of this where people have a voice is making the power centers of the world really nervous and so thats where thats coming from i think and the internet is tricky its weird its full of bots its full of like misinformation of all kinds full of large groups with conspiracy theories and so on and i mean misinformation broadly people are misusing the word misinformation theyre just governments are just labeling random things with misinformation just to censor them but i just think its just like a new world met lots of interesting people there like crazy people anarchists really brilliant people all the above and so i started nights and weekends trying to put together a prototype and my initial thought was well smtp is a protocol that runs email and git is a protocol for version control that people made like gmail and github most people dont wanna run their own email server or even their own git server they just wanna like use a hosted thing that will do all the security and backups for them so the thought in my head at that time was bitcoins this new protocol theres probably gonna be somebody who makes a hosted service that does all the security and backups for you makes bitcoin as a protocol easy to use so maybe i should make like a hosted bitcoin wallet or something that was my it was gonna make gmail for bitcoin or something and a bunch of people told me that was a bad idea like most of my smart friends who i told about it they were like well first of all i dont really get what youre doing at all like bitcoin sounds like a scam or something youve gotten involved in but then other people who understood what bitcoin was told me they thought it was a dumb idea because theyre like dude if you store all this bitcoin youre just gonna get hacked like nobody you know why would you do that and so i kind of had this thought like you know what im not gonna go all in and like make a store everyones bitcoin that would be too much right now i have a job i have a day job you know but let me just make a prototype and ill tell people this is like a beta thing like dont put any real money in it and just see if theres interest and if i feel like im onto something maybe ill go do this as a company cause i did i really wanted to be an entrepreneur at that time i was like i was 29 i was almost turning 30 and i was i always wanted to like start a company but i was you know i wasnt yet i was an employee at a company that was great but so anyway i had this prototype i was hacking together nights and weekends i actually wrote a whole bitcoin node in ruby which turned out to be a maybe a weird decision in hindsight cause ruby wasnt the most performant language weve subsequently had to rebuild that many times but yeah i had this hosted bitcoin wallet and the thing that i didnt have any users for it by the way i applied to y combinator cause i was like maybe if somebody there writes me a check this will like make it feel like a real company and i was trying to find a co founder at that time unsuccessfully so i was basically just wandering in the desert i had a lot of self doubt about this cause i was like i dont know all my friends dont think this is kind of dumb and maybe bitcoin is just gonna get shut down and like this is all be some stupid thing so there was definitely a feeling of just wandering lost in the desert lots of self doubt paul graham and the y combinator group kind of wrote me the first check after i went and interviewed and stuff and they wrote me a check for like 150k and that was the first time somebody who i really looked up to kind of said this is worth pursuing like maybe youre onto something maybe youre not but like lets at least try it and so that was kind of what gave me the confidence to quit my job and try it and ill wrap the story here by saying that like we i found the right co founder after y combinator we still didnt have any customers the thing that i basically launched the hosted bitcoin wallet there were people signing up i just posted on reddit and places like that and maybe like a hundred people would sign up and then nobody would come back and so i was like i just in y combinator they often tell you like talk to your customers and improve your product talk to your customers improve your product thats all youre supposed to be doing try to find product market fit so i emailed like five of the users that had signed up and i was like hey i worked on this app i saw you signed up can i get on the phone with you i get on the phone with like five of these folks and i was like why didnt you come back and the guy was like well the app was okay for a beta but like i dont have any bitcoins so i didnt really know what to do with it and i remember this light bulb kind of went off in my head i was like well if i put a buy bitcoin button in there would you have used it and he was like yeah maybe so then i had this we went about the process my co founder at that time we like got basically had to get like a bank partnership payment rails you know an exchange basic exchange functionality all that stuff i was mentioning earlier in place and the minute we launched that feature where you could just click buy put in your bank counter credit card buy bitcoin it showed up in your account from that day forward like the number of users started to go up like this and so we finally had found product market fit after two years of wandering in the desert so you werent even thinking about to buy the on ramps you would think it would be just the wallet a place to store bitcoin that youve already gotten yeah okay this is i mean cause thats such a pain to do to have to work with others to convert dollars and fiat currency into bitcoin yeah so did you i mean were you overwhelmed by the immensity of the task here or were you just sort of not allowing yourself to think too deeply through this whole thing and just letting the optimism take over here you know i was really looking forward to like doing something crazy and like a big challenge and i wanted to i love kind of crisis moments like that where you know im very determined right and especially when i get like very set on something and im just like you know what im gonna figure out a way to make this fucking thing work like no matter what and so i reveled in that i was sort of i had read all these books about startups and like every startup has these like you know major setbacks and just like nothing works and so that was a sign that youre doing something right i had no idea if i was doing anything right at all but i was like i was kind of loving the experience of it in a weird way it felt it felt stressful at the time like you know nothing was working and but i was just i felt like i was on the right path somehow and so i just kept going i dont know what was the darkest moment that youve gone to in your mind during that time what was what were some of the tougher moments you said self doubt yeah have you yeah whered you go whered you go in your mind is there a moment where youre just like laying there this is this is hopeless well theres a couple of moments im remembering i mean so for whatever reason i had this like big chip on my shoulder at that time and i was like i really want to do something important in the world like you know i could have a good life and like work for some good companies and write some software and im for some reason i never wanted that for myself that probably would have been healthier honestly just to like as an expected value outcome thats probably a better thing in life but i was like i was like man i really want to do something important and have a bigger impact and i was like i was willing to sacrifice a lot for that i was like sleep and not going out with friends and stuff i remember one of the just for like years working on this stuff i remember one of the darker moments was we probably had like maybe five employees at that time and i remember like a bunch of bad things happened like all at once and it was so first of all you have to remember at this time we were all very sleep deprived which kind of exacerbates everything if you look at like the exxon valdez spill and all these like natural disasters like sleep deprivation is often involved so because the reason why we were so sleep deprived is not just because we were working so much but like the site would go offline in the middle of the night and wed get id get paged i was like on pager duty so id get woken up sometimes like two or three times a night like have to try to fix something go back to sleep so in that environment you can kind of get you can get discouraged so one bad thing that happened was we had a bug on the website and there was thousands of people on reddit and twitter who were all like pissed at coinbase because like the balances were showing wrong and they were just like fuck this company its over like i hate these guys and so that was id never had this feeling of a thousand people mad at me at the same time you know i feel like im a pretty chill guy like most of the time people dont get mad at me so that was one another one was that can we pause on that thats so interesting so you were saying like heres a dream im trying to create something and now forever the reputation of this dream is ruined it will never its irrecoverable its over that kind of feeling yeah well i didnt youre right i didnt know at that time i was like is this is this the end like everybody were so were so tiny now everybody hates us so is it over yeah nobody told me this before starting a company that like youre a bunch of people will hate you for this which is like a very counterintuitive thing cause you know most companies i think are doing good things in the world at least youre trying right and so even if someones like trying but theyre not theyre failing im generally rooting for them at least youre trying right but thats not the case at all and most founders ive known have gone through this too where theyre very surprised at the amount of hate that they get and if its i think its actually like a muscle you can build your tolerance to it like because you know you go talk to somebody whos like for you it feels terrible cause youre at the center of this storm and like but if you go then you go talk to like you know your family or some other person like dude i didnt even hear about that like my theyre just busy in their own life and so they they have no idea that you had all this negative press or like whatever it was can i put once again put a link on that yeah theres an interesting person id like to bring up just as an example bill gates yeah so he gets a very large amount of hate on the internet yeah and theres something about him this is me talking that you that he seems out of touch about that hate i believe at least in my understanding that with the resources he has hes trying and is actually doing a lot of good and yet theres a gigantic amount of hate conspiracy theories and stuff like that right and it feels like thats the case because hes somehow out of touch with people where the internet is really finally taking hold where theres billions of devices and everybody has a voice its almost basically governments and powerful people are slightly losing hold of power and theyre starting to freak out a little bit thats it and once you have young people that are coming up now gain power i think well rebalance everything and then theres like you said promising signs that its obvious that the majority of people want freedom and that means a lot of things that means economic freedom that means freedom to have a voice freedom to move around freedom to act in the way they without reasonable sort of limitations by people that dont have their best interests and i gain more hope from just regular people that are fighting and like demanding being able to have freedom of speech or more specifically sort of resisting crude overreach of government in the acts of censorship at least in the united states and hopefully that percolates out to the rest of the world thats struggling on a much more basic level where people are being put in prison for the words they say not just banned from twitter right it could be worse what are some lessons from your failures and your successes about what it takes to run a company i think one of the things that i learned about leadership is that i never really thought of myself as a very natural leader to be honest i dont think i was a natural leader but so i always envisioned good leaders as like these military generals like they seem so confident and theyre just like bark orders charge that hill and do this and i was actually like more introverted and kind of i wasnt really confident in the way i communicated and so what i realized is that theres lots of different kinds of leaders you can be any kind of ceo you want right i was kind of more of like a product technical focus ceo and i preferred to sort of hear everyones opinion and it wasnt just gonna like render a decision in the room in some like kind of heated moment and like piss off half the people i would do like all right im gonna go think about it and ill send you my decision later today or tomorrow or whatever and so i found ways to kind of make it work for me where i could basically i always tried to avoid like when people getting like super emotional about something and like i think theyre thinking their judgment goes down right and just like never make a decision when youre angry right and so i would always sort of try to get a sense of are these people like trying to be right or are they trying to seek the truth and you can do these little tricks like okay you argue that persons position and you argue the other one and like see if you can genuinely represent it now i know youre listening and these kinds of things but i guess sorry getting back to your question about leadership i think i basically just kept doing things that were a little outside my comfort zone and then my comfort zone kept getting bigger and bigger you know and so i think thats how you build confidence is you do the thing thats scary and its like a little outside and like when i first started coinbase i had never managed anybody i would have been scared to death to have put out like a very controversial opinion like that and sort of all right 5 of people will go we didnt know what percent it was gonna be by the way it could have been 1 it could have been 50 like but we went into it scary because it was a scary thing i was like i dont know i think this is right im just gonna do it so if you do enough scary things like youll build the confidence and i feel like im still on that journey every year or two at coinbase theres some big thing that comes out as like oh my god like i didnt sleep well for a week and like this is the next level right but thats how you learn and grow so youre still going up that mountain through the fog one step at a time yeah can i just quickly ask you about a couple of other efforts that are super interesting that youre involved with so first of all a little bit more old school fascinating effort of research hub so whats that about the github for open science yeah okay so basically ive had a chance to try to help a couple other companies get off the ground too cause i wanna see various efforts out there succeed and one of them ive always thought about like why is scientific research not more like open source software or why couldnt it be much faster right and theres youve probably have seen this like in an academic setting right but theres all kinds of things that feel very antiquated to me about scientific research everything from the funding process and grants to how peer review works to how you submit to journals all the costs associated with journals you know that the people youd think like youd get paid for this or something and it would then be available to all the taxpayers for free but no theyre like theyre all pay walled and theres like these big companies that have sort of in my view kind of held back innovation here so and the preprint servers like bioarchive and archiveorg have really helped this but those websites are they look like theyre kind of from like 15 years ago or something yeah its like craigslist or something yeah so anyway one of the things i once coinbase went public last year i had a little bit of liquidity and i was like all right let me fund a small team and lets see if we can if they can like go off and make something better here so we have a prototype out there its at researchhubcom people can check it out and its basically you know the first version is kind of like reddit for science theres like various hubs which are like journals but you know you can publish papers there you can use an electronic lab notebook to sort of have a modern day paper which is not just a pdf thats static but its a living document ideally in the future you know you can get comments and feedback from people in there you can update it over time we want people to be able to share the code and the data sets associated with their paper research paper is not just a pdf and in the future we want to make it even where like you know people can get funding for science through that site and even license out innovations that theyve made because the other thing ive noticed in life is that theres kind of like theres a bunch of people working on science and theres a bunch of people building companies and they very rarely intersect but when they do you get the best things like spacex and genentech and even google and like even coinbase was based on a research paper the bitcoin white paper and so most business people are like creating companies that dont have any scientific innovation theyre just like marketing based on you know whatever and then a lot of scientists are making things which never actually benefit humanity because theyre not commercialized and turned into products and so if we can somehow create a translation layer between those two groups and help them you know helps align the market forces align scientific research to market forces so that theyre more incentivized like if you discover crispr or something like that like you should be a billionaire you know and like all the downstream implications of that not going through some antiquated tech transfer office or whatever and if youre an entrepreneur you should be looking to commercialize the latest scientific innovations and so thats kind of like the longterm vision for that site i think its just an early step today but weve got like a really passionate community on there that are jumping into like you know computer science or longevity or various bio hubs or whatever and like beginning to source the best innovations but also discuss them improve them and publish through the site so i have a question about incentives but first let me say for people listening who are outside of academia might not be familiar with an absurd situation so theres journals like you mentioned and scientists publishing those journals and the journals provide very little value except matching you with reviewers that are unpaid and so in the digital world theyre providing basically almost no value except hosting your paper and they put up a paywall and charge people to access that and that charge is not like even netflix fees youre talking about a lot of money so theyre basically blocking your research that should be wide open from the world and creating a paywall its a fascinating like scam thats actually holding back i dont its a shitty scam because youre not making that much money i feel like a definition of a scam you should at least be making money so like significant amount of money youre basically making shady money and holding back all of human knowledge okay so that put aside and people get a little confused because the journals arent the ones paying the scientists people think like the journals are somehow funding the scientists therefore they have the right to put up a paywall no no no the funding is coming from elsewhere journals are the middleman that nobody asks for especially in the digital world anyway that said there is a interesting kind of incentives for scientists which is prestige and so on so theres a thing with journals if theres a prestigious journal and you pass the review process you get into that journal or a prestigious conference in computer science then thats seen as a good thing in your resume and oh not just your resume within your community thats a respected thing is there some way to achieve that same kind of incentive in the open setting of research hub so like where i could say i got x y and z like look im impressive because this happened on research hub i think youre right like the whole academia like progress track is about like where you got published and how many citations and its kind of like a false economy of reputation because like theres not real money backing it and so i think weve thought about this a little bit and i think the research hub team has an opportunity to do something here that basically says like okay i had the top paper for 2022 in biology on in here and you basically publish a list a leaderboards of these like top for the month the year in all these different categories then actually we should probably give out grants and awards in addition to that fund those people almost like fellows or even give out like you know how like the nobel prize there should be like a research hub prize or something and like ship people maybe even ship like a print version of a journal that is the top papers in each category in each month or whatever and then like people want to put that in their wall and in the lab and like so i do think we need to sort of change i dont know like the traditional folks in academia or science would probably think this is like crazy idea but i think we need to change the culture to not celebrate getting published in paywall journals almost like friends dont let friends publish in like paywall journals like cause thats its just not helping humanity so like you know it should be more prestigious to publish in an open science way and get the top spot that should be celebrated above being published in whatever i dont even want to name one of them you know well theres currently the culture has already shifted to where almost everybody publishes on archive and by archive and so on yeah but so that the culture is there on that scene friends dont let friends not publish open but then the prestige thing is missing which is like anyone can publish an archive so how do you know its actually a strong paper now funny enough even with the crappy systems we have now word of mouth is powerful like you have a like citation system is pretty powerful so like you say okay this is a strong paper we dont need reviewers our human eyes are the reviewers like the community is the reviewers so its already like that part is there but it would be nice to have like you know nature level like this is respect this is a respectful accomplishment yeah and something like a leaderboard but a stable kind of system yeah and i should mention too so theres a crypto angle to this too which is so research hub has a coin associated with research coin and its basically if people you know upvote your paper or like support it youll accumulate more research coin which is basically like rep or like a reward token and so that is a way to i guess measure the communitys collective view of that paper a form of peer review and it can even be weighted by like the reputation of the people voting on it and that sort of thing over time yeah i think the last thing ill just say is that so i think from a rep like a prestige point of view it wont start off that way itll probably start off like being a little more quirky like you know like remember when youtube first started it was like people posting weird cat videos and stuff and but now like you know if you have a million subscribers on youtube thats probably better than getting like a tv show on nbc or whoever the traditional gatekeeper was so my hope it might take 10 years 20 years whatever but im hoping that this can sort of be the new prestigious way that young people publish in science and itll come to be viewed as more prestigious the journals the traditional journals will be viewed as old fashioned well its definitely a system that could do a lot better and theres a lot of incredible brilliant people doing science they deserve better the better platforms so another thing youre taking on and helping out with is this new limit which is looking at longevity whats the idea there yeah okay so as you can see im excited about science like i think you know science is sort of the basically if you get scientific innovation then you get better products and you get better economic growth and then you get all kinds of like surplus in society that can go to arts and philosophy and like all kinds of stuff but with new limits so yeah i kind of got i started hosting some dinners with scientists last year and i was learning about all kinds of the latest stuff happening in bio and theres a lot of really cool stuff happening with like car t cells and crispr and all these things and anyway one of the topics i started to learn more about was something called cell reprogramming and you know people maybe have heard of this induced pluripotent stem cells where you could take like a skin cell and turn it back into a stem cell and shinya yamanaka won the nobel prize for this work that was done in 2006 and you know its kind of a crazy thing you can turn one cell into another type of cell well people recently have been experimenting with different types of transcription factors that would either not you dont want the cell to go all the way back to being a stem cell you can end up getting like cancerous cells and things like that but you want it basically the cell to revert a little bit earlier in its you know it would call it the waddington landscape but its basically like go become act start to act like a bit of a younger cell but not to de differentiate and become more like a stem cell and so i decided this might be an interesting area to go fund i think that that team has come together theres like some really talented people whove come together to help get that off the ground and theyre basically building a platform that can test a lot of different transcription factors on different cell types and hopefully find ways to rejuvenate different types of cells and tissues to extend human health span i mean the moonshot goal here you know the get to mars is that there could be some therapy here that in i dont know 10 or 20 years that you take and from a whole body point of view is sort of rejuvenating tissue not just one type of tissue like your immune system but eventually your whole body maybe even your brain so that you know we dont have that issue where people who are older have trouble learning or theyre more ossified in their thinking to me this is just i always think about you know its actually a little inspired by elon right is like what are some of the biggest things in the world like that are probably high technology risk but if they did work maybe theyre kind of low chance of working but if they did work would have enormous impact i like the idea of trying hard tech problems especially for people like founders like me whove made some money in software which i think were in kind of like a golden age of software so theres like fortunes to be made but if you do make some money in that my hope is people will like do atoms not bits you know and try some of the harder things like in biotech or you know i guess hes doing cars and rockets and stuff but anyway i think we should try hard tech or you know physical science problems as well and see if that can advance for team human yeah so hes also doing bio with neuralink and i feel like bio is tough because its messy we dont understand it as well we dont understand it the risk is higher in terms of not the risk is higher but like you have to deal with the actual sort of to get to human to get to stuff where it could be therapies for actual human bodies is tricky because you have to prove that its safe its effective all those kinds of things with fda i mean its just its tricky its very difficult its a long journey i mean if i can give a quick plug so yeah im on the board at new limit were hiring talented scientists that are interested in the cellular programming space they dont necessarily have to be coming from like an aging background or anything like that theres sort of a small group of people doing even so this is a new thing this is a is new limit relatively new yeah its very new theres a small team today just a handful of people and so were hiring more there if people are excited about that space reach out and same thing for research hub theres a small team there thats really awesome thats doing more like software engineering design product that kind of stuff what advice would you give if you put on your old wise sage hat what advice would you give to young people today high school maybe undergrad and college about life so like career having a career they can be proud of or maybe a life they can be proud of so people can do whatever they want to be happy right so theres not one way to do it i do think that some people a particular type of people out there a lot of people actually they want to have an impact on the world thats how they get a sense of fulfillment right so i mean you need to have like health physical health you need to have good relationships like theres lots of things but most people want to do something important they want to have fulfilling work a way that they can feel like theyre contributing i think a lot of people young people today are thinking like i should be an activist or something like that and theres people in the world who have power and a lot of people who dont i dont have power and so the way to change the world is to speak truth to power or like criticize power and try to pressure them to change to me i dont think thats the right way to actually have an impact on the world because everybody has probably i think people have more power than they realize and by the way its easy to be a critic its hard to actually change these things and fix it and so youll get a lot of accolades from friends and things like that if you kind of go around criticizing its easy to do like everything is broken and could be better including stuff im working on i find like so frustrating theres a million things i want to be better about like what were doing in coinbase so be the person in the arena like that theodore roosevelt quote i think he said it right like go chew glass and stare into the abyss like if you really want to have an impact either join a company that has a mission that is trying to fix the thing youre passionate about or start that company if it doesnt exist or start a charity if its not suitable to be a company or whatever it is but go try to be a part of the solution dont just criticize or be a part of the problem my hope is that more people can realize that they actually can have a meaningful impact that way and i think that to me technology is actually one of the most important ways to improve the world like if you look at climate change like a lot of the best ideas like carbon sequestration all these things its a technology thing right if you want to try to fix education its like look at like khan academy and all this stuff going online right if you want to fix you know whatever transportation and like the financial system and global freedom and like equality of all these things like theres typically the way to get something changed in the world today is with technology and so i do think people its very bizarre to me that theres this kind of like anti tech thing going on look nothing is perfect like if you create something new and like tens of millions of people use it or billions of people use it its like theres going to be some bad people who use it too okay and theres you know society is complicated but like i think most of these things have been net positive because most people in the world are good is at least my view so yes we can mitigate like the 1 of bad people trying to abuse something but 99 of people in the world are good and the way you can improve the world is with technology joining companies starting companies that are working on the right stuff so i hope more young people do that and just if youre not sure what to do like just get started with anything thats how you learn and basically have the optimism that you have the power to do the change so its easy to distract yourself by being the critic thats almost like acknowledging to yourself that thats all you can be but basically everybody has the power to be the fixer i like chew glass and look into the abyss thats much more fun than it sounds what do you think is the meaning of this whole thing why are we here life yep whats the meaning of life whats this existence we got youre trying to increase the amount of economic freedom on this planet or trying to alleviate some of the suffering yeah but why i dont really think there is any point to life you know somebody once told me you know if you go into these like kind of really big existential questions it can get a little scary because like you stare off the cliff and theres like theres nothing there you know this one person told me one time they were like you know brian you should probably snorkel dont scuba i guess and i think they were trying to say like i some of my friends have done this right theyll go to like you know epic meditation retreats and like theyll kind of come back with all this existential dread of like whats the meaning of it all and then like as far as i can tell we are just some organic molecules in the ocean started like dividing and replicating and the selfish gene and all this stuff like basically ended up here and our only its some kind of like really naive algorithm thats just kind of trying to get us to survive and replicate and we have dna just like every other animal and so we happened to develop these like really cool neocortexes and so now were sort of self aware and we have all these big questions and maybe well create another you know as computers get better well create the simulation inside our thing and i think its cool like we should basically i just want to keep watching the movie you know unfold thats part of why i want to work on like new limit is really cool cause its helped if people can live longer whether thats uploading their brain to the cloud or you know basically through we get biology to work or the strong ai to work or whatever one of those two hopefully works out and then we get to keep watching the movie and see how it all unfolds i think thats fun and so i dont know if thats like an answer but i guess i dont think theres any real purpose so just try to have fun well the cool thing is that we get to write the movie as we watch it yeah thats exactly right i mean thats like the steve jobs quote and all that where hes like everything around you was invented by somebody who just was like this was a crazy idea they thought up so once you realize you can kind of do anything you want then thats what you start to go you start to go try crazier stuff i mean this is another one of those areas where not to get too out there but like you know when youre i think you can build your comfort zone around like people being upset with you you can also build your range of what you think is possible right like when i was in my 20s i was like reading all these books about like self improvement and goal how to write down your goals and stuff and my goals were like someday i wanna make 100000 a year or something like and that was and you know and it seemed like a little outlandish or what i wrote down these goals like i wanna own rental property or something anyway and then i slowly started to get some of these things done over a couple of years and so i started to think a little bigger i remember one time i wrote down this goal where i was like whats the craziest thing i could think of and i was like what if i i wanna write i wanna start a billion dollar tech company thats crazy and i had never started like a million dollar tech company or any tech company really so what business did i have writing that goal down i remember i wrote that on a piece of paper like like probably every day for a year or something almost right i dont know if it was every day but like i wrote it down a lot and so little things started to happen i was like all right well maybe i should move back to the bay area from buenos aires maybe i should try to apply to y combinator or whatever like and i started thinking about these ideas and so whatever it gets you fired up it doesnt have to be like some company goal or startup thing it could be anything right maybe you wanna publish a book or like do something creatively or whatever anyway i think like within seven years no its probably more like 10 years of me writing that goal down coinbase had a valuation over a billion dollars so it was out of my realm of what was even possible and then within 10 years you can accomplish more in 10 years than you think less in a year than you think so now im like okay whats the next goal whats the okay maybe i wanna get a billion people accessing the open financial system through our products every day that would be cool for humanity and thats a pretty crazy goal like theres only 8 billion people or something right so theres one out of eight or maybe i can radically like if i make some like the right investments or whatever i can like help radically extend human health span or whatever right so try crazier stuff i dont know even if it doesnt work like hopefully youll advance the state of affairs like something interesting will happen and so most people today they look at people trying this stuff and theyre like oh my god theyre so theyre a genius or whatever and its like or theyre an idiot like one of the two neither one are true its just like anybody can start by thinking about what they want and then like go for it and then once you get that like go for something a little bigger and like you just have fun with it and the universe is a way of smiling and helping you out if you just write it down and you dream big theres something about just karma about the energy you put into this world other people will help you out doors will open youll notice that the doors opened and you actually have a shot at making it happen its a funny world yeah i mean i dont really subscribe to all like the woo woo interpretations of this but my very rational brain interpretation of it is that if you just wake up every day and write down like what you want to get done and towards your longer goals your larger goals its just on your mind that day so you start to notice opportunities and you think about it more so brian thank you for dreaming big thank you for doing what youre doing doing incredible engineering at scale trying to help people from all over the world and actually helping me personally get more into crypto just cause its so easy so thank you so much and thank you so much for giving your extremely valuable time today to this awesome conversation thanks for your awesome podcast i love it and i listen to it often thanks for listening to this conversation with brian armstrong to support this podcast please check out our sponsors in the description and now let me leave you with some words from benjamin franklin an investment in knowledge pays the best interest thank you for listening and hope to see you next time so i wonder how you stay in touch with the voice of the people without being destroyed by the outrage is there any wisdom you have to that or i dont know about wisdom but ive thought about this too because yeah you wanna always be open to feedback especially from people who have like your best interests at heart right and if you can become isolated from it and just like you know surrounded by yes people and i mean who knows maybe like she and putin and people like that are in situations i have no idea but if you listen to too much of it and you just try to please everyone youll never get anything done and i mean most of the best leaders are people who they can act when they believe that theyre doing something net positive for the world and humanity and they actually dont really care if they piss off some portion of the people almost anything youre gonna do of significance in the world today is gonna piss off 5 of people maybe 49 of people or whatever maybe 60 i dont know so you never wanna become so surrounded by people who just work for you and will say yes and then you think like well im a genius and im like thats how you become a dictator or whatever but you also cant care so much about what people think because then youll never do anything thats truly authentic to yourself one other thought on that by the way i think its a really good question so ive thought about this a lot like why you know people generally kind of hate on zuck and they hate on bill gates and they hate on they dont really hate on elon well actually elon has a lot of haters too but its a different thing this is measured this is measured i was looking at some surveys so i think zuck is the most so loved and hated right zuckerberg is the most both loved and hated hes the most hated and then i think its bill gates and elon is down there i think its like 40 hate zuck people asked and then elon is in the double digits but low double digits and so its interesting you just look at this data ask yourself why right so i ask myself this sometimes too because i dont claim to know any of these people well but like ive met them briefly and my impression is that theyre actually all smart people trying to do good things in the world so theres not too much difference there despite public perception so why is it that some are really hated and some arent i mean its a complicated question obviously zuck in his facebook got blamed for the whole election thing and all that didnt help social media has gotten a lot of pressure just from like hey why arent you solving all of societys tough problems its like well theyre just one company but one thing ive noticed is that a lot of these people they have like aspergers right a little bit and sometimes people with aspergers dont really emote in the same way and so i think its almost a form of like bias against their cognitive type or something which is like that person doesnt emote right i dont trust their intentions and the other thing ive thought about too is that sometimes i think some leaders like maybe zuck or bill gates they can come across as like a little bit pr rehearsed like theyre basically theyre giving the pr approved answers where elon just says whatever he thinks like to a fault so even if people hate what he says or like at least i believe its authentic so ive always thought about that too for myself im like how do i cause you can fuck it up on both sides right like if you just come out and youre like saying whatever stream of consciousness youll often end up like pissing off people on your team or like saying tripping over some like regulation that youve theres all kinds of things about running a public company you cant say certain stuff but if youre too pr approved and your answer is like nobody trusts you what youre saying and so anyway this is something i think about a lot i dont think i have the right answer but im trying to find that balance and more and more with the internet theres a premium on authenticity just like youre saying people really really appreciate that so for leaders its a challenge to be how do i make sure im authentic but also dont say stupid shit and so thats an interesting thing ive noticed that just having interacted with a bunch of leaders that you have to be careful how much you surround yourself with pr folks because the best i would say let me just say a nice thing about marketing and pr folks the best marketing folks are extremely good so they understand exactly what great marketing is and great pr its authenticity its showing revealing the beauty as opposed to pr and marketing out of fear oh dont say that dont say this dont that because then you start living in this kind of that pushes you towards a bubble where you cant express the your beautiful quirks and weirdness and all that kind of stuff and also the cool the beautiful things about what youre doing i find like especially with tech things like even like coinbase the way to reveal the beauty of it is not only by showing all the things you could do with it but showing that theres great engineering going on underneath so letting the nerds shine too it doesnt have to be like these kind of commercials where its like a happy family using coinbase to send a transaction about flowers for mom or something like that like it could be also like gritty stuff and real stuff so thats a general just observation i made but you said you were talking about dark moments and that theres people on the internet that were pissed off that the site was down and you said there might be something else yeah so sleep deprived like a bunch of people on the internet were pissed at me the balances were fucked up like people were tweeting the companys over just give the money back whatever and then oh yeah somebody posted so we had all this we didnt we started to get all these customer support inquiries and like we only had like a few people at the company and so we were backed up maybe like 20000 support requests so people couldnt get ahold of us so somebody posted my cell phone number on reddit and they were like they were like if you need to get ahold of the ceo whatever cause everyones upset about where their money is so i remember were in the office its like late at night weve been working like 12 hours were all sleep deprived im trying to hack and like get this bug fixed and we all need like food at the office and so my phone has been blowing up all day cause someone posted my phone number on the internet and theres like a guy there was a guy like trying to deliver food and i needed to answer my phone to like get the food from downstairs so i was like shit i gotta just see who if thats him so i started answering the call and its like is this brian im like nope wrong number click and i pick up the next call its like every when i finished the call another call is like coming in so i was like im a reporter from japan like asking about a security nope wrong number click and then i like finally i get the delivery guy downstairs bring the food up we were all like surviving to like fix this bug i remember there was just basically a point that night where i was like fuck i need to just i basically just curled up on like a ball on the floor and i just like cried for a little bit i think i let myself just kind of wallow in self pity kind of took a nap for about five minutes and i was like lets fucking solve this and i like you know stop being like a little whatever and like got back up sleep deprivation combined with just the stress and the pressure of the site going down and everybody wants the site to be up just the pressure from people and the number of users is growing and growing and growing so that pressure is just mentally mentally tough what was your source of strength during that time like what like somebody that patted you on the back and said we got this yeah well it definitely helped to have a co founder so you know theres like that old saying about its better to be in a great relationship than to be single but its better to be single than in a bad relationship so co founders actually blow up a lot of companies too but when you find the right co founder which i was lucky to find with with fred or some that was very important there was definitely moments where you know i was like kind of you know at the width end or whatever and he was like its like dude lets rally like and he basically carried the team you know a couple of times like in really key moments what advice would you give to startup founders about this particular stage about surviving it to the five and through the five employees stage where you were yeah well if your pre product market fit the best advice that i have from that period is action produces information so just like keep doing stuff you know i remember like paul graham paul graham had this great line like that i think thats his line and he was like startups are like sharks if they stop swimming they die you know so even if youre like not sure what to do like just do anything because when you do it itll like itll produce some information like people liked it they didnt this was very true for me there was times where i just did something instead of debating it endlessly and like just try it you know like all right so we shipped it and like there was a couple of times where like the minute i shipped it and i was like i knew i know we built this wrong but now i have an idea of what to do next and it wasnt i only would have had the idea if wed actually gone through the exercise of going to build it its like my other favorite analogy for this is that youre like at the base of a mountain thats shrouded in fog and youre looking up at the mountain and youre trying to think like okay how do i get up there but you can only see like three or four steps ahead cause the fog is so thick so you have to just take steps into the unknown and when you take three steps another three steps will be revealed ahead of you and sometimes youll end up on some local maximum youll have to retrace your steps or whatever but or come up to a cliff you know but most people in life dont take the steps into the fog into the unknown because its scary or theyre like i dont know what if i fail or like i dont know how thats going to work or i might run out of money or i wont be able to get a job after or i dont know whatever reason but that is like one of the things that separates i think entrepreneurial people with that kind of inclination is that they have sort of a comfort with this risk tolerance but its actually not really risky if you think about it its not like you know at least in most places like you know if you go to a startup and it fails like youre going to youre even more valuable to your next employer right or you can go raise a seed round pay yourself a salary try it for like two years or three years if it doesnt work go get another job its not like youre you werent paying yourself a salary during that time so i think i think people overestimate the risk of doing a startup and they just never they never start because it seems crazy and all your friends think its silly like thats sort of the default nature of every big startup idea its just basic fear its the same kind of fear that if you see a if youre a guy see a cute girl at a bar its the fear associated with coming up to her you like her asking her its like whats the actual risk exactly right shell say no thanks im not interested no thanks i guess the risk is like thats going to be mentally difficult to deal with rejection so just like its mentally difficult to deal with failure if you had a bunch of ideas and you were excited about them and you implement them and you realize theyre not good that could be difficult to keep pushing through that but i suppose thats life youre supposed to you know perseverance through the failures and then the risk is low so thats and then the whole time through the fog up the mountain youre looking for product market fit yeah thats right so you know you have it when the usage of your product keeps growing without any marketing dollars or anything like that its just like more people keep coming back every week or month so youre kind of keep youre basically watching your stats nothing is working you see these little wiggles of false hope in your metrics and you basically just keep talking to customers fixing the improving the product talk to customers improve the product talk to customers improve product you know and try not to run out of money so be really scrappy and then if youre lucky you hit some kind of threshold where like okay the thing is good enough now or we hit on some use case and then itll organically start to grow a bit and then you have a whole different set of problems once you hit product market fit which is how do we scale this thing how do we hire people how do we you know hire an executive team or raise more money and like so the problems totally change but yeah well you were there through the whole thing so thats the other question thats fascinating again back to the girl at the bar how do you hire people its like how do you find good friends how do you find good relationships and in this specific case how do you hire good people engineers executive all of it one thing is ive done a lot of reps on hiring at this point so coinbase has about 5000 people probably the first 500 people or something maybe in that range you know i interviewed every single one of those but you have to remember theres probably like i dont know on average maybe 10 people that we went in the process for every one we hired or something so it was like by the time that we had 500 employees i had done like 5000 interviews or something i was like very burned out on interviews i had been doing some days i did like seven interviews in a day or maybe you know youve been doing lots of interviews maybe you wouldnt get burned out but different kind of interviews very different very different very different because youre so first of all most of your interviews lead to rejection yeah which is also exhausting yeah and theres a whole part of the interview which is about candidate experience right sometimes you know its not the right person but you wanna make sure they have a good experience yes like if youre just exhausted and youre on your sixth interview and youre like well thanks for coming in and you wrap and you just and then like youre gonna create a detractor someone whos out there like fuck that company or brian was rude to me or whatever so i had to honestly i had to work on that a little bit in the early days because i was doing so many interviews like i needed to make sure that when people came in i was like you know made them feel comfortable asked them a couple of like warmup questions just like oh how was it getting in the office like did you find it okay and like what have you been up to this week and not just like you know like a factory assembly line like boom boom boom like yeah but also theres a moment cause ive interviewed a bunch of people for like teams and stuff theres also a moment when you early on know its not gonna be a good fit and you still have to land that plane and all that kind of stuff and that could get really really really exhausting so yeah anyway sorry so yeah so basically we tried all weve tried so many things over the years to make interviews more efficient cause its a huge time sink for the team so you know we basically well usually get them down to like 25 minutes ive seen if youre trying to hire like a big team lets say you know of people who are like contractors or something not necessarily full time employees ive seen people actually do 10 minute interviews you can even interview like a thousand people almost like in a week or something im not sure if that quite works out but let me a little less than that but you can basically get six and six done in an hour if youre just i need to get a team of 30 contractors for whatever purpose but if youre talking about full time employees i usually do like 25 minute you know youre oftentimes like one thing weve done is well put like a google form online and its like put some basic hurdles in there like you know ask them to put in an answer which you can check in a spreadsheet if it was correct or not and like there was some funny examples in the early days of coinbase where wed put in like brain teasers and stuff but we dont do that anymore we do like normal interviews we do references the kinds of things i ask in interviews you know its usually like i like to think about what do we need this person to accomplish in this role right and get really specific about that its like usually something pretty hard and then ill ask them a question its like tell me about a time you did x and or tell me about the hardest the hardest kind of problem youve had to solve in y and what did you do specifically to overcome it right so im asking to see if they can actually do the stuff we need to get done but then im also kind of asking like culture questions if im interviewing for that and so im trying to see like are they concise communicators can they just give me a clear answer and stop talking some people like ramble on for like five 10 minutes if you ask the first question some people are you know theyre interrupters like church of interruption so like they wont stop talking until you interrupt them which for me im always patient and i wait so thats weird im looking to see for humility too like you know ill tell us people ill tell you about a time something went really wrong like you had conflict with someone on a team or what im kind of looking for is were they part of the solution or are they still holding onto like blame and criticism about that and be like well i told them they shouldnt do that way but they didnt listen to me and you know these are all like bad signs so im looking for yeah can they get the job done will they work together on a team can they communicate effectively do they fit into our cultural values and you know those kinds of things yeah i mean theres a cause ive even for help with this podcast here but also at mit and so on ive done a bunch of hiring and i was always looking for you said brain teasers all kinds of simple questions that can they can reveal a lot of information and its always been challenging i used to i still ask this question but do you think its better to work hard or work smart and you know i had this idea that ive that i think ive matured about which is i kind of believe that people who say work smart on that question dont actually work smart so the right textbook answer is its better to work smart but the reality is its people that havent actually ever done anything that say work smart theyre like they havent really struggled because my general belief at the time was in order to discover what it means to work smart to be efficient to you have to work your ass off so you have to really fail a lot and failure feels like hard work and so i was always suspicious of people that would say work smart i would want to interrogate that question but then i also you know have learned that there is people that are just exceptionally exceptionally efficient they really do know what it means to work smart even at a young age and so like you cant just disqualify based on that you have to dig in deeper but some of the most interesting people ive ever worked with would say work hard unapologetically and theyre usually the ones that know how to be efficient which is its just an interesting thing like that and ive always searched for questions of that nature to see can i get a person to reveal something profound about them in as brief of a question as possible and i you know and then of course theres basic attention to detail and brain teasers and stuff like that depending on the role programming and so on to see can they solve a tricky puzzle and do so like one that doesnt require a lot of effort but requires a certain nonlinear way of thinking is there some i mean maybe you dont want to reveal but is there some questions that you sometimes find yourself leaning on you said like how did you solve a hard problem in your past and have them talk through it thats one you know we started with brain teasers periodically at coinbase and we got away from that relatively quickly and i think one its a tough one because i actually think it does show how somebody kind of performs under pressure but its i dont think its a super reliable indicator because theres some people who are really good in the typical work situation but thats not a typical work situation where somebody puts you on the spot like in a live interview and sometimes people get nervous and they cant think clearly and like they dont have their computer in front of them or whatever they normally use so yeah im a little skeptical now of the brain teaser thing there is a whole yeah there is a whole question about like a lot of universities are getting rid of you know entrance exams so if youre hiring right out of universities sometimes its becoming a less reliable indicator of like are they in that university and ive heard some companies we havent done this yet but ive heard some companies are actually creating their own like for college grads like their own basically exams like standardized testing almost to get people in the door because the degree almost like doesnt mean what it used to which is the whole topic but yeah thats fascinating because its fascinating both for that because its not just about you trying to hire a great team its also to help them find the right place to work at yeah its like a two way street all right so once you found the product market fit how did coinbase become what it is today ooh so let me ask an engineering question actually sort of from the ruby wallet days what are some of the interesting challenges there or are they not engineering just the things that had to be solved what were they engineering regulation financial hiring lawyers what was it so post product market fit yeah a lot of its scaling and you got to build out an actual company so i remember i was still writing a lot of code there for a while and we were hiring in we had like maybe 25 people or something i remember one of our investors came by one day and he was like brian how much of your time are you spending writing code and i was like maybe 50 or something and he was like how much time are you spending hiring people i was like probably 20 and he was like i think you need to flip those numbers like this company is not going to scale youre the ceo you dont need to be writing code every day youre going to have to transition that stuff like even if people cant all that stuffs locked in your head so maybe theyre not going to do it as well as you for the first six months or something but like if you dont start to transition it youre never going to build a real company its just going to be youre going to be the bottleneck so you know like a lot of founders that took me a while to like really internalize that lesson id always heard people say that and you know but i still was holding on too much to decision making and i probably still am by the way like even to this day at coinbase where we continually have to push down decision making in the org like even with 5000 people like who are the owners of each of these things and so the temptation is people to push it up and you become a bottleneck and anyway so yeah you basically need to make sure you have enough money where you dont die if theres some kind of a downturn or hit break even profitability we were in a position where we were periodically profitable during up periods but then crypto would go down and we were unprofitable and so we had to kind of manage our own psychology and the balance sheet to make sure we didnt like die in the downturn which a lot of crypto companies did we had to basically professionalize a whole bunch of services that had been just very quickly thrown together by like 20 year olds right whether that was cybersecurity its like okay how do you get like a really senior experienced cybersecurity person but not someone whos so senior that they cant get their hands dirty and they can come into a company with 25 50 people how do you get a finance person to come in and do that our finances were a mess like we didnt even really know how much money we had at certain times and stuff i mean this was its embarrassing to say but it was true like i remember there was a point where we had raised i think like our series c or something like that and i think we had our bank accounts i just put like 25 million like in a different bank account that none of this stuff was touched to the actual operations of business cause i was like our operations were so messy and we needed to hire a new finance person and i was like id heard horror stories of actually startups where they thought they had x amount of money and then it turned out they had way less and then the whole thing was insolvent in like three weeks so you wanted to have some padding to at least like all right i can at least count on this to save us if we go to like super negative right i mean it was like a cheap hack but that was like the only i could come up with and until we could hire like a real cfo and finance team who like okay now we got our arms around how much cash we have it sounds silly but we had such high volume of money coming in and out anyway what was the ordering of hiring by the way like how many engineers was it early on you said cfo was not you didnt even have a cfo for a bit like what was the landscape of hiring as you building up this company was it engineering focused well lets see i mean so the first person we hired was just like we need to solve customer support so we brought someone to do that because we were all staying up till midnight every night trying to do customer support and then we got more engineers and then i think maybe the sixth hire or something like that was a recruiter cause that turned out to be you need to build hire the person who can hire more people that turned out to be a great force multiplier and then youre going down the list eventually you want to hire some more senior people we needed legal and compliance we needed that really badly cause we it was all kinds of questions about what the legality of it was was it hard to find legal people that work with crypto like serious adults cause its such a cutting edge new world yeah i mean there was nobody who had like more than nobody had three years of experience with it cause it had only been around a few years so yeah we were finding people from adjacent fields theres a certain personality type of people who are willing to join early companies because they have no structure you cant really commit to them about youre going to have this team or this boss or whatever like everythings in chaos and flux so it takes yeah hiring is one of the hardest things in the early stage for sure you got to find people crazy enough to join you on this journey so one of the interesting things about coinbase and youve written weve talked well talk about it a bit youre very focused on the mission yeah youre very kind of i think that simplifies things that makes hiring easier that makes working at coinbase easier that makes i mean its similar so elon has the same thing its pretty clear its pretty clear what were here to do so i suppose whats the mission of coinbase well its to increase economic freedom in the world and what is economic freedom yeah so economic freedom is this term kind of like gdp that economists use and its basically a measure of different countries around the world it looks at things like are there property rights enforced is there free trade is the currency stable can you start companies that you wanna start and can you join the ones you wanna join and is there corruption and bribery prevalent or is it relatively free of that and so theres several different organizations that basically score countries by economic freedom and the really cool thing about economic freedom is that basically it positively correlates with things that we all want in society like not only higher growth of the economy but also things like higher self reported happiness of citizens better treatment of the environment better income for the poorest 10 of people and it negatively correlates with things we dont want in society like corruption and bribery and war even in things like that and so its this pretty crazy provocative idea which is that if you give people good property rights and rule of law and allow them to trade it basically encourages them to do more good stuff and the whole society benefits like one of the things you may have noticed this growing up in various places you did or i spent a year living in buenos aires argentina that went through hyperinflation and theres a certain like pessimism that can creep into countries when they dont have economic freedom which its basically like everyone has this bit of this vibe which is like dont stick your head up dont try too hard because it could all be gone tomorrow like the things that really are valuable in life are just family and friends and the past was better than the future will be and so you dont really people dont try as many they dont try hard because youre not really sure you can actually keep the upside of your labor if you try hard so you just dont try as hard whereas in america historically or high economic freedom countries people basically like they just try more stuff because theyre like if i do good for other people ill get to keep part of it for myself and i can improve my lot in life and for my children and my community whatever so i realized when i read the bitcoin white paper a long time ago that at least i had a hunch at the time i was like this might be a really powerful piece of technology that can inject good financial infrastructure into all these countries around the world that dont have it basically good economic freedom principles in like property rights and things like that into these countries all over the world which just as long as you had a smartphone and now crypto got invented everybody could have economic freedom and its crypto is kind of really well suited for economic freedom because if you want property rights its based like crypto is if you can remember a 12 word phrase or have an app on your phone you can store as much wealth as you want and it cant be taken away from you you can even theres like refugees who need to flee and they wanna take their wealth with them and they cant do it often in the traditional financial system and so crypto lets them do that right crypto is inherently global so it allows free trade and cross border payments it makes it easy to accept payments from people globally it provides a stable currency to everyone'"

Jordan, a professor at Berkeley and one of the most influential people in the history of machine learning, statistics, and artificial intelligence. He has been cited over 170,000 times and he has mentored many of the world class researchers defining the field of AI today, including Andrew Ng, Zubin Garamani, Ben Taskar, and Yoshua Bengio. All this, to me, is as impressive as the over 32,000 points in the six NBA championships of the Michael J. Jordan of basketball fame. There's a nonzero probability that I talked to the other Michael Jordan given my connection to and love of the Chicago Bulls of the 90s, but if I had to pick one, I'm going with the Michael Jordan of statistics and computer science, or as Yann LeCun calls him, the Miles Davis of machine learning. In his blog post titled Artificial Intelligence, the Revolution Hasn't Happened Yet, Michael argues for broadening the scope of the artificial intelligence field. In many ways, the underlying spirit of this podcast is the same, to see artificial intelligence as a deeply human endeavor, to not only engineer algorithms and robots, but to understand and empower human beings at all levels of abstraction, from the individual to our civilization as a whole. This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.

Cash App lets you send money to friends, buy Bitcoin, and invest in the stock market with as little as $1. Since Cash App does fractional share trading, let me mention that the order execution algorithm that worked behind the scenes to create the abstraction of the fractional orders is to me an algorithmic marvel. Great props for the Cash App engineers for solving a hard problem that in the end provides an easy interface that takes a step up to the next layer of abstraction over the stock market, making trading more accessible for new investors and diversification much easier. So once again, if you get Cash App from the App Store or Google Play and use the code LEX PODCAST, you'll get $10 and Cash App will also donate $10 to First, one of my favorite organizations that is helping to advance robotics and STEM education for young people around the world. And now, here's my conversation with Michael I. Jordan. Given that you're one of the greats in the field of AI, machine learning, computer science, and so on, you're trivially called the Michael Jordan of machine learning, although as you know, you were born first, so technically MJ is the Michael I. Jordan of basketball. But anyway, my favorite is Yann LeCun calling you the Miles Davis of machine learning because as he says, you reinvent yourself periodically and sometimes leave fans scratching their heads after you change direction. So can you put at first your historian hat on and give a history of computer science and AI as you saw it, as you experienced it, including the four generations of AI successes that I've seen you talk about? Sure. Yeah, first of all, I much prefer Yann's metaphor. Miles Davis was a real explorer in jazz and he had a coherent story. So I think I have one, but it's not just the one you lived, it's the one you think about later. What the historian does is they look back and they revisit. I think what's happening right now is not AI, that was an intellectual aspiration that's still alive today as an aspiration. But I think this is akin to the development of chemical engineering from chemistry or electrical engineering from electromagnetism. So if you go back to the 30s or 40s, there wasn't yet chemical engineering. There was chemistry, there was fluid flow, there was mechanics and so on. But people pretty clearly viewed interesting goals to try to build factories that make chemicals products and do it viably, safely, make good ones, do it at scale. So people started to try to do that, of course, and some factories worked, some didn't, some were not viable, some exploded, but in parallel, developed a whole field called chemical engineering. Electrical engineering is a field, it's no bones about it, it has theoretical aspects to it, it has practical aspects. It's not just engineering, quote unquote, it's the real thing, real concepts are needed. Same thing with electrical engineering. There was Maxwell's equations, which in some sense were everything you know about electromagnetism, but you needed to figure out how to build circuits, how to build modules, how to put them together, how to bring electricity from one point to another safely and so on and so forth. So a whole field that developed called electrical engineering. I think that's what's happening right now, is that we have a proto field, which is statistics, more of the theoretical side of it, algorithmic side of computer science, that was enough to start to build things, but what things? Systems that bring value to human beings and use human data and mix in human decisions. The engineering side of that is all ad hoc. That's what's emerging. In fact, if you wanna call machine learning a field, I think that's what it is, that it's a proto form of engineering based on statistical and computational ideas of previous generations. But do you think there's something deeper about AI in his dreams and aspirations as compared to chemical engineering and electrical engineering? Well the dreams and aspirations maybe, but those are 500 years from now. I think that that's like the Greeks sitting there and saying, it would be neat to get to the moon someday. I think we have no clue how the brain does computation. We're just a clueless. We're even worse than the Greeks on most anything interesting scientifically of our era. Can you linger on that just for a moment because you stand not completely unique, but a little bit unique in the clarity of that. Can you elaborate your intuition of why we're, like where we stand in our understanding of the human brain? And a lot of people say, you know, scientists say we're not very far in understanding human brain, but you're like, you're saying we're in the dark here. Well, I know I'm not unique. I don't even think in the clarity, but if you talk to real neuroscientists that really study real synapses or real neurons, they agree, they agree. It's a hundreds of year task and they're building it up slowly and surely. What the signal is there is not clear. We think we have all of our metaphors. We think it's electrical, maybe it's chemical, it's a whole soup, it's ions and proteins and it's a cell. And that's even around like a single synapse. If you look at a electron micrograph of a single synapse, it's a city of its own. And that's one little thing on a dendritic tree, which is extremely complicated electrochemical thing. And it's doing these spikes and voltages are flying around and then proteins are taking that and taking it down into the DNA and who knows what. So it is the problem of the next few centuries. It is fantastic. But we have our metaphors about it. Is it an economic device? Is it like the immune system or is it like a layered set of, you know, arithmetic computations? We have all these metaphors and they're fun. But that's not real science per se. There is neuroscience. That's not neuroscience. All right. That's like the Greek speculating about how to get to the moon, fun, right? And I think that I like to say this fairly strongly because I think a lot of young people think we're on the verge because a lot of people who don't talk about it clearly let it be understood that, yes, we kind of, this is a brain inspired, we're kind of close, you know, breakthroughs are on the horizon. And that's scrupulous people sometimes who need money for their labs. That's what I'm saying, scrupulous, but people will oversell, I need money for my lab, I'm studying computational neuroscience, I'm going to oversell it. And so there's been too much of that. So I'll step into the gray area between metaphor and engineering with, I'm not sure if you're familiar with brain computer interfaces. So a company like Elon Musk has Neuralink that's working on putting electrodes into the brain and trying to be able to read, both read and send electrical signals. Just as you said, even the basic mechanism of communication in the brain is not something we understand. But do you hope without understanding the fundamental principles of how the brain works, we'll be able to do something interesting at that gray area of metaphor? It's not my area. So I hope in the sense, like anybody else hopes for some interesting things to happen from research, I would expect more something like Alzheimer's will get figured out from modern neuroscience. There's a lot of human suffering based on brain disease and we throw things like lithium at the brain, it kind of works, no one has a clue why. That's not quite true, but mostly we don't know. And that's even just about the biochemistry of the brain and how it leads to mood swings and so on. How thought emerges from that, we were really, really completely dim. So that you might want to hook up electrodes and try to do some signal processing on that and try to find patterns, fine, by all means, go for it. It's just not scientific at this point. So it's like kind of sitting in a satellite and watching the emissions from a city and trying to infer things about the microeconomy, even though you don't have microeconomic concepts. It's really that kind of thing. And so yes, can you find some signals that do something interesting or useful? Can you control a cursor or mouse with your brain? Yeah, absolutely, and then I can imagine business models based on that and even medical applications of that. But from there to understanding algorithms that allow us to really tie in deeply from the brain to computer, I just, no, I don't agree with Elon Musk. I don't think that's even, that's not for our generations, not even for the century. So just in hopes of getting you to dream, you've mentioned Kolmogorov and Turing might pop up, do you think that there might be breakthroughs that will get you to sit back in five, 10 years and say, wow? Oh, I'm sure there will be, but I don't think that there'll be demos that impress me. I don't think that having a computer call a restaurant and pretend to be a human is a breakthrough. Right. And people, you know, some people present it as such. It's imitating human intelligence. It's even putting coughs in the thing to make a bit of a PR stunt. And so fine that the world runs on those things too. And I don't want to diminish all the hard work and engineering that goes behind things like that and the ultimate value to the human race. But that's not scientific understanding. And I know the people that work on these things, they are after scientific understanding. In the meantime, they've got to kind of, you know, the trains got to run and they got mouths to feed and they got things to do and there's nothing wrong with all that. I would call that though, just engineering. And I want to distinguish that between an engineering field, like electrical engineering and chemical engineering that originally emerged, that had real principles and you really know what you're doing and you had a little scientific understanding, maybe not even complete. So it became more predictable and it really gave value to human life because it was understood. And so we don't want to muddle too much these waters of, you know, what we're able to do versus what we really can't do in a way that's going to impress the next. So I don't need to be wowed, but I think that someone comes along in 20 years, a younger person who's absorbed all the technology and for them to be wowed, I think they have to be more deeply impressed. A young Kolmogorov would not be wowed by some of the stunts that you see right now coming from the big companies. The demos, but do you think the breakthroughs from Kolmogorov would be, and give this question a chance, do you think there'll be in the scientific fundamental principles arena or do you think it's possible to have fundamental breakthroughs in engineering? Meaning, you know, I would say some of the things that Elon Musk is working with SpaceX and then others sort of trying to revolutionize the fundamentals of engineering, of manufacturing, of saying, here's a problem we know how to do a demo of and actually taking it to scale. Yeah. So there's going to be all kinds of breakthroughs. I just don't like that terminology. I'm a scientist and I work on things day in and day out and things move along and eventually you say, wow, something happened, but I don't like that language very much. Also I don't like to prize theoretical breakthroughs over practical ones. I tend to be more of a theoretician and I think there's lots to do in that arena right now. And so I wouldn't point to the Kolmogorovs, I might point to the Edisons of the era and maybe Musk is a bit more like that. But you know, Musk, God bless him, also will say things about AI that he knows very little about and he leads people astray when he talks about things he doesn't know anything about. Trying to program a computer to understand natural language, to be involved in a dialogue we're having right now, that ain't going to happen in our lifetime. You could fake it, you can mimic, sort of take old sentences that humans use and retread them, but the deep understanding of language, no, it's not going to happen. And so from that, I hope you can perceive that the deeper, yet deeper kind of aspects and intelligence are not going to happen. Now will there be breakthroughs? No, I think that Google was a breakthrough, I think Amazon is a breakthrough, you know, I think Uber is a breakthrough, you know, that bring value to human beings at scale in new, brand new ways based on data flows and so on. A lot of these things are slightly broken because there's not kind of an engineering field that takes economic value in context of data and, you know, planetary scale and worries about all the externalities, the privacy, you know, we don't have that field so we don't think these things through very well. I see that as emerging and that will be, you know, looking back from 100 years, that will be a constituted breakthrough in this era, just like electrical engineering was a breakthrough in the early part of the last century and chemical engineering was a breakthrough. So the scale, the markets that you talk about and we'll get to will be seen as sort of breakthrough and we're in the very early days of really doing interesting stuff there and we'll get to that, but just taking a quick step back, can you give, kind of throw off the historian hat. I mean, you briefly said that the history of AI kind of mimics the history of chemical engineering, but... I keep saying machine learning. You keep wanting to say AI, just to let you know, I don't, you know, I resist that. I don't think this is about AI really was John McCarthy as almost a philosopher saying, wouldn't it be cool if we could put thought in a computer? If we could mimic the human capability to think or put intelligence in, in some sense into a computer. That's an interesting philosophical question and he wanted to make it more than philosophy. He wanted to actually write down a logical formula and algorithms that would do that. And that is a perfectly valid, reasonable thing to do. That's not what's happening in this era. So the reason I keep saying AI actually, and I'd love to hear what you think about it. Machine learning has a very particular set of methods and tools. Maybe your version of it is that mine doesn't, it's very, very open. It does optimization, it does sampling, it does... So systems that learn is what machine learning is. Systems that learn and make decisions. And make decisions. So it's not just pattern recognition and, you know, finding patterns, it's all about making decisions in real worlds and having close feedback loops. So something like symbolic AI, expert systems, reasoning systems, knowledge based representation, all of those kinds of things, search, does that neighbor fit into what you think of as machine learning? So I don't even like the word machine learning, I think that what the field you're talking about is all about making large collections of decisions under uncertainty by large collections of entities. Right? And there are principles for that, at that scale. You don't have to say the principles are for a single entity that's making decisions, single agent or single human. It really immediately goes to the network of decisions. Is a good word for that or no? No, there's no good words for any of this. That's kind of part of the problem. So we can continue the conversation to use AI for all that. I just want to kind of raise the flag here that this is not about, we don't know what intelligence is and real intelligence. We don't know much about abstraction and reasoning at the level of humans. We don't have a clue. We're not trying to build that because we don't have a clue. Eventually it may emerge. They'll make, I don't know if there'll be breakthroughs, but eventually we'll start to get glimmers of that. It's not what's happening right now. Okay. We're taking data. We're trying to make good decisions based on that. We're trying to scale. We're trying to economically viably, we're trying to build markets. We're trying to keep value at that scale and aspects of this will look intelligent. Computers were so dumb before, they will seem more intelligent. We will use that buzzword of intelligence so we can use it in that sense. So machine learning, you can scope it narrowly as just learning from data and pattern recognition. But when I talk about these topics, maybe data science is another word you could throw in the mix, it really is important that the decisions are as part of it. It's consequential decisions in the real world. Am I going to have a medical operation? Am I going to drive down the street? Things where there's scarcity, things that impact other human beings or other environments and so on. How do I do that based on data? How do I do that adaptively? How do I use computers to help those kinds of things go forward? Whatever you want to call that. So let's call it AI. Let's agree to call it AI, but let's not say that the goal of that is intelligence. The goal of that is really good working systems at planetary scale that we've never seen before. So reclaim the word AI from the Dartmouth conference from many decades ago of the dream of humans. I don't want to reclaim it. I want a new word. I think it was a bad choice. I mean, if you read one of my little things, the history was basically that McCarthy needed a new name because cybernetics already existed and he didn't like, no one really liked Norbert Wiener. Norbert Wiener was kind of an island to himself and he felt that he had encompassed all this and in some sense he did. You look at the language of cybernetics, it was everything we're talking about. It was control theory and signal processing and some notions of intelligence and closed feedback loops and data. It was all there. It's just not a word that lived on partly because of the maybe the personalities. But McCarthy needed a new word to say, I'm different from you. I'm not part of your show. I got my own. Invented this word and again, thinking forward about the movies that would be made about it, it was a great choice. But thinking forward about creating a sober academic and real world discipline, it was a terrible choice because it led to promises that are not true that we understand. We understand artificial perhaps, but we don't understand intelligence. It's a small tangent because you're one of the great personalities of machine learning, whatever the heck you call the field. Do you think science progresses by personalities or by the fundamental principles and theories and research that's outside of personalities? Both. And I wouldn't say there should be one kind of personality. I have mine and I have my preferences and I have a kind of network around me that feeds me and some of them agree with me and some of them disagree, but all kinds of personalities are needed. Right now, I think the personality that it's a little too exuberant, a little bit too ready to promise the moon is a little bit too much in ascendance. And I do think that there's some good to that. It certainly attracts lots of young people to our field, but a lot of those people come in with strong misconceptions and they have to then unlearn those and then find something to do. And so I think there's just got to be some multiple voices and I wasn't hearing enough of the more sober voice. So as a continuation of a fun tangent and speaking of vibrant personalities, what would Yeah. And you think technically speaking, it's possible to help. I don't know the answers, but it's a, it's a, it's a less anonymity, a little more locality, you know, worlds that you kind of enter in and you trust the people there in those worlds so that when you start having a discussion, you know, not only is that people are not going to hurt you, but it's not going to be a total waste of your time because there's a lot of wasting of time that, you know, a lot of us, I pulled out of Facebook early on cause it was clearly going to waste a lot of my time even though there was some value. And so, yeah, worlds that are somehow you enter in and you know what you're getting and it's kind of appeals to you and you might, new things might happen, but you kind of have some, some trust in that world. And there's some deep, interesting, complex psychological aspects around anonymity, how that changes human behavior that's quite dark. Quite dark. Yeah. I think a lot of us are, especially those of us who really loved the advent of technology. I love social networks when they came out. I was just, I didn't see any negatives there at all. But then I started seeing comment sections. I think it was maybe, you know, with the CNN or something. And I started to go, wow, this, this darkness I just did not know about and, and our technology is now amplifying it. So sorry for the big philosophical question, but on that topic, do you think human beings, cause you've also, out of all things, had a foot in psychology too, the, do you think human beings are fundamentally good? Like all of us have good intent that could be mind or is it depending on context and environment, everybody could be evil. So my answer is fundamentally good. But fundamentally limited. All of us have very, you know, blinkers on. We don't see the other person's pain that easily. We don't see the other person's point of view that easily. We're very much in our own head, in our own world. And on my good days, I think the technology could open us up to, you know, more perspectives and more less blinkered and more understanding, you know, a lot of wars in human history happened because of just ignorance. They didn't, they, they thought the other person was doing this while their person wasn't doing this. And we have a huge amounts of that. But in my lifetime, I've not seen technology really help in that way yet. And I do, I do, I do believe in that, but you know, no, I think fundamentally humans are good. The people suffer, people have grievances because you have grudges and those things cause them to do things they probably wouldn't want. They regret it often. So no, I, I think it's a, you know, part of the progress of technology is to indeed allow it to be a little easier to be the real good person you actually are. Well, but do you think individual human life or society could be modeled as an optimization problem? Not the way I think typically, I mean, that's, you're talking about one of the most complex phenomenon in the whole, you know, in all of which the individual human life or society as a whole. Both, both. I mean, individual human life is amazingly complex. And so you know, optimization is kind of just one branch of mathematics that talks about certain kinds of things. And it just feels way too limited for the complexity of such things. What properties of optimization problems do you think, so do you think most interesting problems that could be solved through optimization, what kind of properties does that surface have non convexity, convexity, linearity, all those kinds of things, saddle points? Well, so optimization is just one piece of mathematics. You know, there's like, you just, even in our era, we're aware that say sampling is coming up, examples of something coming up with a distribution. What's optimization? What's sampling? Well, they, you can, if you're a kind of a certain kind of mathematician, you can try to blend them and make them seem to be sort of the same thing. But optimization is roughly speaking, trying to find a point that, a single point that is the optimum of a criterion function of some kind. And sampling is trying to, from that same surface, treat that as a distribution or density and find points that have high density. So I want the entire distribution in a sampling paradigm and I want the, you know, the single point, that's the best point in the optimization paradigm. Now if you were optimizing in the space of probability measures, the output of that could be a whole probability distribution. So you can start to make these things the same. But in mathematics, if you go too high up that kind of abstraction hierarchy, you start to lose the, you know, the ability to do the interesting theorems. So you kind of don't try that. You don't try to overly over abstract. So as a small tangent, what kind of worldview do you find more appealing? One that is deterministic or stochastic? Well, that's easy. I mean, I'm a statistician. You know, the world is highly stochastic. I don't know what's going to happen in the next five minutes, right? Because what you're going to ask, what we're going to do, what I'll say. Due to the uncertainty. Due to the... Massive uncertainty. Yeah. You know, massive uncertainty. And so the best I can do is have come rough sense or probability distribution on things and somehow use that in my reasoning about what to do now. So how does the distributed at scale when you have multi agent systems look like? So optimization can optimize sort of, it makes a lot more sense, sort of at least from my from robotics perspective, for a single robot, for a single agent, trying to optimize some objective function. When you start to enter the real world, this game theoretic concept starts popping up. That's how do you see optimization in this? Because you've talked about markets in a scale. What does that look like? Do you see it as optimization? Do you see it as sampling? Do you see like, how should you mark? These all blend together. And a system designer thinking about how to build an incentivized system will have a blend of all these things. So, you know, a particle in a potential well is optimizing a functional called a Lagrangian, right? The particle doesn't know that. There's no algorithm running that does that. It just happens. And so it's a description mathematically of something that helps us understand as analysts what's happening, right? And so the same thing will happen when we talk about, you know, mixtures of humans and computers and markets and so on and so forth, there'll be certain principles that allow us to understand what's happening, whether or not the actual algorithms are being used by any sense is not clear. Now at some point, I may have set up a multi agent or market kind of system. And I'm now thinking about an individual agent in that system. And they're asked to do some task and they're incentivized in some way, they get certain signals and they have some utility. What they will do at that point is they just won't know the answer, they may have to optimize to find an answer. Okay, so an artist could be embedded inside of an overall market. You know, and game theory is very, very broad. It is often studied very narrowly for certain kinds of problems. But it's roughly speaking, this is just the, I don't know what you're going to do. So I kind of anticipate that a little bit, and you anticipate what I'm anticipating. And we kind of go back and forth in our own minds. We run kind of thought experiments. You've talked about this interesting point in terms of game theory, you know, most optimization problems really hate saddle points, maybe you can describe what saddle points are. But I've heard you kind of mentioned that there's a there's a branch of optimization that you could try to explicitly look for saddle points as a good thing. Oh, not optimization. That's just game theory that that so there's all kinds of different equilibria in game theory. And some of them are highly explanatory behavior. They're not attempting to be algorithmic. They're just trying to say, if you happen to be at this equilibrium, you would see certain kind of behavior. And we see that in real life. That's what an economist wants to do, especially behavioral economists in continuous differential game theory, you're in continuous spaces, a some of the simplest equilibria are saddle points and Nash equilibrium as a saddle point. It's a special kind of saddle point. So classically, in game theory, you were trying to find Nash equilibria and an algorithmic game theory, you're trying to find algorithms that would find them. And so you're trying to find saddle points. I mean, so that's literally what you're trying to do. But you know, any economist knows that Nash equilibria have their limitations. They are definitely not that explanatory in many situations. They're not what you really want. There's other kind of equilibria. And there's names associated with these because they came from history with certain people working on them, but there will be new ones emerging. So you know, one example is a Stackelberg equilibrium. So you know, Nash, you and I are both playing this game against each other or for each other, maybe it's cooperative, and we're both going to think it through and then we're going to decide and we're going to do our thing simultaneously. You know, in a Stackelberg, no, I'm going to be the first mover. I'm going to make a move. You're going to look at my move and then you're going to make yours. Now since I know you're going to look at my move, I anticipate what you're going to do. And so I don't do something stupid, but then I know that you are also anticipating me. So we're kind of going back and forth on why, but there is then a first mover thing. And so those are different equilibria, right? And so just mathematically, yeah, these things have certain topologies and certain shapes that are like, what's it, algorithmically or dynamically, how do you move towards them? How do you move away from things? You know, so some of these questions have answers, they've been studied, others do not. And especially if it becomes stochastic, especially if there's large numbers of decentralized things, there's just, you know, young people get in this field who kind of think it's all done because we have, you know, TensorFlow. Well, no, these are all open problems and they're really important and interesting. And it's about strategic settings. How do I collect data? Suppose I don't know what you're going to do because I don't know you very well, right? Well, I got to collect data about you. So maybe I want to push you into a part of the space where I don't know much about you so I can get data. Cause, and then later I'll realize that you'll never, you'll never go there because of the way the game is set up. You know, that's part of the overall, you know, data analysis context is that. Even the game of poker is fascinating space, whenever there's any uncertainty, a lack of information, it's a super exciting space. Just to linger on optimization for a second. So when we look at deep learning, it's essentially minimization of a complicated loss function. So is there something insightful or hopeful that you see in the kinds of function surface that loss functions, the deep learning and in the real world is trying to optimize over? Is there something interesting as it's just the usual kind of problems of optimization? I think from an optimization point of view, that surface, first of all, it's pretty smooth. And secondly, if there's over, if it's over parameterized, there's kind of lots of paths down to reasonable Optima. And so kind of the getting downhill to the, to an optimum is viewed as not as hard as you might've expected in high dimensions. The fact that some Optima tend to be really good ones and others not so good. And you tend to, it's not, sometimes you find the good ones is sort of still needs explanation. Yeah. But, but the particular surface is coming from the particular generation of neural nets. I kind of suspect those will, those will change in 10 years. It will not be exactly those surfaces. There'll be some others that are an optimization theory will help contribute to why other surfaces or why other algorithms. Years of arithmetic operations with a little bit of nonlinearity, that's not, that didn't come from neuroscience per se. I mean, maybe in the minds of some of the people working on it, they were thinking about brains, but they were arithmetic circuits in all kinds of fields, computer science control theory and so on. And that layers of these could transform things in certain ways. And that if it's smooth, maybe you could find parameter values is a sort of big discovery that it's working, it's able to work at this scale. But I don't think that we're stuck with that and we're, we're certainly not stuck with that cause we're understanding the brain. So in terms of on the algorithm side sort of gradient descent, do you think we're stuck with gradient descent as a variance of it? What variance do you find interesting or do you think there'll be something else invented that is able to walk all over these optimization spaces in more interesting ways? So there's a co design of the surface and the, or the architecture and the algorithm. So if you just ask if we stay with the kind of architectures that we have now and not just neural nets, but you know, phase retrieval architectures or matrix completion architectures and so on. You know, I think we've kind of come to a place where yeah, a stochastic gradient algorithms are dominant and there are versions that are a little better than others. They have more guarantees, they're more robust and so on. And there's ongoing research to kind of figure out which is the best arm for which situation. But I think that that'll start to co evolve, that that'll put pressure on the actual architecture. And so we shouldn't do it in this particular way, we should do it in a different way because this other algorithm is now available if you do it in a different way. So that I can't really anticipate that co evolution process, but you know, gradients are amazing mathematical objects. They have a lot of people who start to study them more deeply mathematically are kind of shocked about what they are and what they can do. Think about it this way, suppose that I tell you if you move along the x axis, you go uphill in some objective by three units, whereas if you move along the y axis, you go uphill by seven units, right? Now I'm going to only allow you to move a certain unit distance, right? What are you going to do? Well, most people will say that I'm going to go along the y axis, I'm getting the biggest bang for my buck, you know, and my buck is only one unit, so I'm going to put all of it in the y axis, right? And why should I even take any of my strength, my step size and put any of it in the x axis because I'm getting less bang for my buck. That seems like a completely clear argument and it's wrong because the gradient direction is not to go along the y axis, it's to take a little bit of the x axis. And to understand that, you have to know some math and so even a trivial so called operator like gradient is not trivial and so, you know, exploiting its properties is still very important. Now we know that just pervading descent has got all kinds of problems, it gets stuck in many ways and it had never, you know, good dimension dependence and so on. So my own line of work recently has been about what kinds of stochasticity, how can we get dimension dependence, how can we do the theory of that and we've come up pretty favorable results with certain kinds of stochasticity. We have sufficient conditions generally. We know if you do this, we will give you a good guarantee. We don't have necessary conditions that it must be done a certain way in general. So stochasticity, how much randomness to inject into the walking along the gradient? And what kind of randomness? Why is randomness good in this process? Why is stochasticity good? Yeah, so I can give you simple answers but in some sense again, it's kind of amazing. Stochasticity just, you know, particular features of a surface that could have hurt you if you were doing one thing deterministically won't hurt you because by chance, there's very little chance that you would get hurt. So here stochasticity, it just kind of saves you from some of the particular features of surfaces. In fact, if you think about surfaces that are discontinuous in our first derivative, like an absolute value function, you will go down and hit that point where there's nondifferentiability. And if you're running a deterministic algorithm at that point, you can really do something bad. Whereas stochasticity just means it's pretty unlikely that's going to happen, that you're going to hit that point. So it's again, nontrivial to analyze but especially in higher dimensions, also stochasticity, our intuition isn't very good about it but it has properties that kind of are very appealing in high dimensions for a lot of large number of reasons. So it's all part of the mathematics to kind of, that's what's fun to work in the field is that you get to try to understand this mathematics. But long story short, you know, partly empirically, it was discovered stochastic gradient is very effective and theory kind of followed, I'd say, that but I don't see that we're getting clearly out of that. What's the most beautiful, mysterious, a profound idea to you in optimization? I don't know the most. But let me just say that Nesterov's work on Nesterov acceleration to me is pretty surprising and pretty deep. Can you elaborate? Well Nesterov acceleration is just that, suppose that we are going to use gradients to move around in a space. For the reasons I've alluded to, they're nice directions to move. And suppose that I tell you that you're only allowed to use gradients, you're not going to be allowed to use this local person that can only sense kind of the change in the surface. But I'm going to give you kind of a computer that's able to store all your previous gradients. And so you start to learn some something about the surface. And I'm going to restrict you to maybe move in the direction of like a linear span of all the gradients. So you can't kind of just move in some arbitrary direction, right? So now we have a well defined mathematical complexity model. There's certain classes of algorithms that can do that and others that can't. And we can ask for certain kinds of surfaces, how fast can you get down to the optimum? So there's answers to these. So for a smooth convex function, there's an answer, which is one over the number of steps squared. You will be within a ball of that size after k steps. Gradient descent in particular has a slower rate, it's one over k. So you could ask, is gradient descent actually, even though we know it's a good algorithm, is it the best algorithm? And the answer is no. Well, not clear yet, because one over k squared is a lower bound. That's probably the best you can do. Gradient is one over k, but is there something better? And so I think as a surprise to most, Nesterov discovered a new algorithm that has got two pieces to it. It's two gradients and puts those together in a certain kind of obscure way. And the thing doesn't even move downhill all the time. It sometimes goes back uphill. And if you're a physicist, that kind of makes some sense. You're building up some momentum and that is kind of the right intuition, but that intuition is not enough to understand kind of how to do it and why it works. But it does. It achieves one over k squared and it has a mathematical structure and it's still kind of to this day, a lot of us are writing papers and trying to explore that and understand it. So there are lots of cool ideas and optimization, but just kind of using gradients, I think is number one that goes back, you know, 150 years. And then Nesterov, I think has made a major contribution with this idea. So like you said, gradients themselves are in some sense, mysterious. They're not as trivial as... Not as trivial. Coordinate descent is more of a trivial one. You just pick one of the coordinates. That's how we think. That's how our human mind thinks. That's how our human minds think. And gradients are not that easy for our human mind to grapple with. An absurd question, but what is statistics? So here it's a little bit, it's somewhere between math and science and technology. It's somewhere in that convex hole. So it's a set of principles that allow you to make inferences that have got some reason to be believed and also principles that allow you to make decisions where you can have some reason to believe you're not going to make errors. So all of that requires some assumptions about what do you mean by an error? What do you mean by the probabilities? But after you start making some of those assumptions, you're led to conclusions that, yes, I can guarantee that if you do this in this way, your probability of making an error will be small. Your probability of continuing to not make errors over time will be small. And the probability that you found something that's real will be small, will be high. So decision making is a big part of that. Decision making is a big part. Yeah. So statistics, short history was that, it goes back as a formal discipline, 250 years or so. It was called inverse probability because around that era, probability was developed sort of especially to explain gambling situations. Of course, interesting. So you would say, well, given the state of nature is this, there's a certain roulette board that has a certain mechanism and what kind of outcomes do I expect to see? And especially if I do things long amounts of time, what outcomes will I see? And the physicists started to pay attention to this. And then people said, well, let's turn the problem around. What if I saw certain outcomes, could I infer what the underlying mechanism was? That's an inverse problem. And in fact, for quite a while, statistics was called inverse probability. That was the name of the field. And I believe that it was Laplace who was working in Napoleon's government who needed to do a census of France, learn about the people there. So he went and gathered data and he analyzed that data to determine policy and said, well, let's call this field that does this kind of thing statistics because the word state is in there. In French, that's etat, but it's the study of data for the state. So anyway, that caught on and it's been called statistics ever since. But by the time it got formalized, it was sort of in the 30s. And around that time, there was game theory and decision theory developed nearby. People in that era didn't think of themselves as either computer science or statistics or control or econ. They were all the above. And so Von Neumann is developing game theory, but also thinking of that as decision theory. Wald is an econometrician developing decision theory and then turning that into statistics. And so it's all about, here's not just data and you analyze it, here's a loss function. Here's what you care about. Here's the question you're trying to ask. Here is a probability model and here's the risk you will face if you make certain decisions. And to this day, in most advanced statistical curricula, you teach decision theory as the starting point and then it branches out into the two branches of Bayesian and frequentist. But that's all about decisions. In statistics, what is the most beautiful, mysterious, maybe surprising idea that you've come across? Yeah, good question. I mean, there's a bunch of surprising ones. There's something that's way too technical for this thing, but something called James Stein estimation, which is kind of surprising and really takes time to wrap your head around. Can you try to maybe... I think I don't want to even want to try. Let me just say a colleague at Steven Stigler at University of Chicago wrote a really beautiful paper on James Stein estimation, which helps to... It's views a paradox. It kind of defeats the mind's attempts to understand it, but you can and Steve has a nice perspective on that. So one of the troubles with statistics is that it's like in physics that are in quantum physics, you have multiple interpretations. There's a wave and particle duality in physics and you get used to that over time, but it still kind of haunts you that you don't really quite understand the relationship. The electron's a wave and electron's a particle. Well the same thing happens here. There's Bayesian ways of thinking and frequentist, and they are different. They sometimes become sort of the same in practice, but they are physically different. And then in some practice, they are not the same at all. They give you rather different answers. And so it is very much like wave and particle duality, and that is something that you have to kind of get used to in the field. Can you define Bayesian and frequentist? Yeah in decision theory you can make, I have a video that people could see. It's called are you a Bayesian or a frequentist and kind of help try to make it really clear. It comes from decision theory. So you know, decision theory, you're talking about loss functions, which are a function of data X and parameter theta. They're a function of two arguments. Okay. Neither one of those arguments is known. You don't know the data a priori. It's random and the parameters unknown. All right. So you have a function of two things you don't know, and you're trying to say, I want that function to be small. I want small loss, right? Well what are you going to do? So you sort of say, well, I'm going to average over these quantities or maximize over them or something so that, you know, I turn that uncertainty into something certain. So you could look at the first argument and average over it, or you could look at the second argument and average over it. That's Bayesian and frequentist. So the frequentist says, I'm going to look at the X, the data, and I'm going to take that as random and I'm going to average over the distribution. So I take the expectation loss under X. Theta is held fixed, right? That's called the risk. And so it's looking at other, all the data sets you could get, right? And say, how well will a certain procedure do under all those data sets? That's called a frequentist guarantee, right? So I think it is very appropriate when like you're building a piece of software and you're shipping it out there and people are using it on all kinds of data sets. You want to have a stamp, a guarantee on it that as people run it on many, many data sets that you never even thought about that 95% of the time it will do the right thing. Perfectly reasonable. The Bayesian perspective says, well, no, I'm going to look at the other argument of the loss function, the theta part, okay? That's unknown and I'm uncertain about it. So I could have my own personal probability for what it is, you know, how many tall people are there out there? I'm trying to infer the average height of the population while I have an idea roughly what the height is. So I'm going to average over the theta. So now that loss function as only now, again, one argument's gone, now it's a function of X and that's what a Bayesian does is they say, well, let's just focus on the particular X we got, the data set we got, we condition on that. Conditional on the X, I say something about my loss. That's a Bayesian approach to things. And the Bayesian will argue that it's not relevant to look at all the other data sets you could have gotten and average over them, the frequentist approach. It's really only the data sets you got, right? And I do agree with that, especially in situations where you're working with a scientist, you can learn a lot about the domain and you're really only focused on certain kinds of data and you gathered your data and you make inferences. I don't agree with it though, that, you know, in the sense that there are needs for frequentist guarantees, you're writing software, people are using it out there, you want to say something. So these two things have to got to fight each other a little bit, but they have to blend. So long story short, there's a set of ideas that are right in the middle that are called empirical Bayes. And empirical Bayes sort of starts with the Bayesian framework. It's kind of arguably philosophically more, you know, reasonable and kosher. Write down a bunch of the math that kind of flows from that, and then realize there's a bunch of things you don't know because it's the real world and you don't know everything. So you're uncertain about certain quantities. At that point, ask, is there a reasonable way to plug in an estimate for those things? Okay. And in some cases, there's quite a reasonable thing to do, to plug in, there's a natural thing you can observe in the world that you can plug in and then do a little bit more mathematics and assure yourself it's really good. So based on math or based on human expertise, what's, what, what are good? Oh, they're both going in. The Bayesian framework allows you to put a lot of human expertise in, but the math kind of guides you along that path and then kind of reassures you the end, you could put that stamp of approval under certain assumptions, this thing will work. So you asked the question, what's my favorite, you know, or what's the most surprising, nice idea. So one that is more accessible is something called false discovery rate, which is, you know, you're making not just one hypothesis test or making one decision, you're making a whole bag of them. And in that bag of decisions, you look at the ones where you made a discovery, you announced that something interesting had happened. All right. That's going to be some subset of your big bag. In the ones you made a discovery, which subset of those are bad? Or false, false discoveries. You'd like the fraction of your false discoveries among your discoveries to be small. That's a different criterion than accuracy or precision or recall or sensitivity and specificity. It's a different quantity. Those latter ones are almost all of them have more of a frequentist flavor. They say, given the truth is that the null hypothesis is true. Here's what accuracy I would get, or given that the alternative is true, here's what I would get. So it's kind of going forward from the state of nature to the data. The Bayesian goes the other direction from the data back to the state of nature. And that's actually what false discovery rate is. It says, given you made a discovery, okay, that's conditioned on your data. What's the probability of the hypothesis? It's going the other direction. And so the classical frequency look at that, well, I can't know that there's some priors needed in that. And the empirical Bayesian goes ahead and plows forward and starts writing down these formulas and realizes at some point, some of those things can actually be estimated in a reasonable way. And so it's kind of, it's a beautiful set of ideas. So I, this kind of line of argument has come out. It's not certainly mine, but it sort of came out from Robbins around 1960. Brad Efron has written beautifully about this in various papers and books. And the FDR is, you know, Benjamin in Israel, John Story did this Bayesian interpretation and so on. And he used to absorb these things over the years and find it a very healthy way to think about statistics. Let me ask you about intelligence to jump slightly back out into philosophy, perhaps. You said that maybe you can elaborate, but you said that defining just even the question of what is intelligence is a very difficult question. Is it a useful question? Do you think we'll one day understand the fundamentals of human intelligence and what it means, you know, have good benchmarks for general intelligence that we put before our machines? So I don't work on these topics so much that you're really asking the question for a psychologist really. And I studied some, but I don't consider myself at least an expert at this point. You know, a psychologist aims to understand human intelligence, right? And I think many psychologists I know are fairly humble about this. They might try to understand how a baby understands, you know, whether something's a solid or liquid or whether something's hidden or not. And maybe how a child starts to learn the meaning of certain words, what's a verb, what's a noun and also, you know, slowly but surely trying to figure out things. But humans ability to take a really complicated environment, reason about it, abstract about it, find the right abstractions, communicate about it, interact and so on is just, you know, really staggeringly rich and complicated. And so, you know, I think in all humility, we don't think we're kind of aiming for that in the near future. A certain psychologist doing experiments with babies in the lab or with people talking has a much more limited aspiration. And you know, Kahneman and Tversky would look at our reasoning patterns and they're not deeply understanding all the how we do our reasoning, but they're sort of saying, hey, here's some oddities about the reasoning and some things you should think about it. But also, as I emphasize in some things I've been writing about, you know, AI, the revolution hasn't happened yet. Yeah. Great blog post. I've been emphasizing that, you know, if you step back and look at intelligent systems of any kind and whatever you mean by intelligence, it's not just the humans or the animals or, you know, the plants or whatever, you know, so a market that brings goods into a city, you know, food to restaurants or something every day is a system. It's a decentralized set of decisions. Looking at it from far enough away, it's just like a collection of neurons. Every neuron is making its own little decisions, presumably in some way. And if you step back enough, every little part of an economic system is making all of its decisions. And just like with the brain, who knows what an individual neuron does and what the overall goal is, right? But something happens at some aggregate level, same thing with the economy. People eat in a city and it's robust. It works at all scales, small villages to big cities. It's been working for thousands of years. It works rain or shine, so it's adaptive. So all the kind of, you know, those are adjectives one tends to apply to intelligent systems. Robust, adaptive, you know, you don't need to keep adjusting it, self healing, whatever. Plus not perfect. You know, intelligences are never perfect and markets are not perfect. But I do not believe in this era that you cannot, that you can say, well, our computers are, our humans are smart, but you know, no markets are not, more markets are. So they are intelligent. Now we humans didn't evolve to be markets. We've been participating in them, right? But we are not ourselves a market per se. The neurons could be viewed as the market. There's economic, you know, neuroscience kind of perspective. That's interesting to pursue all that. The point though is, is that if you were to study humans and really be the world's best psychologist studied for thousands of years and come up with the theory of human intelligence, you might have never discovered principles of markets, you know, supply demand curves and you know, matching and auctions and all that. Those are real principles and they lead to a form of intelligence that's not maybe human intelligence. It's arguably another kind of intelligence. There probably are third kinds of intelligence or fourth that none of us are really thinking too much about right now. So if you really, and then all of those are relevant to computer systems in the future. Certainly the market one is relevant right now. Whereas the understanding of human intelligence is not so clear that it's relevant right now. Probably not. So if you want general intelligence, whatever one means by that, or, you know, understanding intelligence in a deep sense and all that, it is definitely has to be not just human intelligence. It's gotta be this broader thing. And that's not a mystery. Markets are intelligent. So, you know, it's definitely not just a philosophical stance to say we've got to move beyond intelligence. That sounds ridiculous. Yeah. But it's not. And in that blog post, you define different kinds of like intelligent infrastructure, AI, which I really like is some of the concepts you've just been describing. Do you see ourselves, if we see earth, human civilization as a single organism, do you think the intelligence of that organism, when you think from the perspective of markets and intelligence infrastructure is increasing, is it increasing linearly? Is it increasing exponentially? What do you think the future of that intelligence? Yeah, I don't know. I don't tend to think, I don't tend to answer questions like that because you know, that's science fiction. I'm hoping to catch you off guard. Well again, because you said it's so far in the future, it's fun to ask and you'll probably, you know, like you said, predicting the future is really nearly impossible. But say as an axiom, one day we create a human level, a superhuman level intelligent, not the scale of markets, but the scale of an individual. What do you think it is, what do you think it would take to do that? Or maybe to ask another question is how would that system be different than the biological human beings that we see around us today? Is it possible to say anything interesting to that question or is it just a stupid question? It's not a stupid question, but it's science fiction. Science fiction. And so I'm totally happy to read science fiction and think about it from time in my own life. I loved, there was this like brain in a vat kind of, you know, little thing that people were talking about when I was a student, I remember, you know, imagine that, you know, between your brain and your body, there's a, you know, there's a bunch of wires, right? And suppose that every one of them was replaced with a literal wire. And then suppose that wire was turned in actually a little wireless, you know, there's a receiver and sender. So the brain has got all the senders and receiver, you know, on all of its exiting, you know, axons and all the dendrites down to the body have replaced with senders and receivers. Now you could move the body off somewhere and put the brain in a vat, right? And then you could do things like start killing off those senders and receivers one by one. And after you've killed off all of them, where is that person? You know, they thought they were out in the body walking around the world and they moved on. So those are science fiction things. Those are fun to think about. It's just intriguing about where is, what is thought, where is it and all that. And I think every 18 year old should take philosophy classes and think about these things. And I think that everyone should think about what could happen in society that's kind of bad and all that. But I really don't think that's the right thing for most of us that are my age group to be doing and thinking about. I really think that we have so many more present, you know, first challenges and dangers and real things to build and all that such that, you know, spending too much time on science fiction, at least in public for like this, I think is not what we should be doing. Maybe over beers in private. That's right. Well, I'm not going to broadcast where I have beers because this is going to go on Facebook and I don't want a lot of people showing up there. But yeah, I'll, I love Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, YouTube. I have I'm optimistic and hopeful, but maybe, maybe I don't have grounds for such optimism and hope. But let me ask, you've mentored some of the brightest sort of some of the seminal figures in the field. Can you give advice to people who are undergraduates today? What does it take to take, you know, advice on their journey if they're interested in machine learning and in the ideas of markets from economics and psychology and all the kinds of things that you've exploring? What steps should they take on that journey? Well, yeah, first of all, the door is open and second, it's a journey. I like your language there. It is not that you're so brilliant and you have great, brilliant ideas and therefore that's just, you know, that's how you have success or that's how you enter into the field. It's that you apprentice yourself, you spend a lot of time, you work on hard things, you try and pull back and you be as broad as you can, you talk to lots of people. And it's like entering in any kind of a creative community. There's years that are needed and human connections are critical to it. So, you know, I think about, you know, being a musician or being an artist or something, you don't just, you know, immediately from day one, you know, you're a genius and therefore you do it. No, you, you know, practice really, really hard on basics and you be humble about where you are and then, and you realize you'll never be an expert on everything. So you kind of pick and there's a lot of randomness and a lot of kind of luck, but luck just kind of picks out which branch of the tree you go down, but you'll go down some branch. So yeah, it's a community. So the graduate school is, I still think is one of the wonderful phenomena that we have in our, in our world. It's very much about apprenticeship with an advisor. It's very much about a group of people you belong to. It's a four or five year process. So it's plenty of time to start from kind of nothing to come up to something, you know, more, more expertise, and then to start to have your own creativity start to flower, even surprising your own self. And it's a very cooperative endeavor. I think a lot of people think of science as highly competitive and I think in some other fields it might be more so. Here it's way more cooperative than you might imagine. And people are always teaching each other something and people are always more than happy to be clear that, so I feel I'm an expert on certain kinds of things, but I'm very much not expert on lots of other things and a lot of them are relevant and a lot of them are, I should know, but should in some society, you know, you don't. So I'm always willing to reveal my ignorance to people around me so they can teach me things. And I think a lot of us feel that way about our field. So it's very cooperative. I might add it's also very international because it's so cooperative. We see no barriers. And so that the nationalism that you see, especially in the current era and everything is just at odds with the way that most of us think about what we're doing here, where this is a human endeavor and we cooperate and are very much trying to do it together for the, you know, the benefit of everybody. So last question, where and how and why did you learn French and which language is more beautiful English or French? Great question. So first of all, I think Italian is actually more beautiful than French and English. And I also speak that. So I'm married to an Italian and I have kids and we speak Italian. Anyway, all kidding aside, every language allows you to express things a bit differently. And it is one of the great fun things to do in life is to explore those things. So in fact, when I kids or teens or college students ask me what they study, I say, well, do what your heart, where your heart is, certainly do a lot of math. Math is good for everybody, but do some poetry and do some history and do some language too. You know, throughout your life, you'll want to be a thinking person. You'll want to have done that. For me, French I learned when I was, I'd say a late teen, I was living in the middle of the country in Kansas and not much was going on in Kansas with all due respect to Kansas. And so my parents happened to have some French books on the shelf and just in my boredom, I pulled them down and I found this is fun. And I kind of learned the language by reading. And when I first heard it spoken, I had no idea what was being spoken, but I realized I had somehow knew it from some previous life and so I made the connection. But then I traveled and just I love to go beyond my own barriers and my own comfort or whatever. And I found myself on trains in France next to say older people who had lived a whole life of their own. And the ability to communicate with them was special and the ability to also see myself in other people's shoes and have empathy and kind of work on that language as part of that. So after that kind of experience and also embedding myself in French culture, which is quite amazing, languages are rich, not just because there's something inherently beautiful about it, but it's all the creativity that went into it. So I learned a lot of songs, read poems, read books. And then I was here actually at MIT where we're doing the podcast today and a young professor not yet married and not having a lot of friends in the area. So I just didn't have, I was kind of a bored person. I said, I heard a lot of Italians around. There's happened to be a lot of Italians at MIT, an Italian professor for some reason. And so I was kind of vaguely understanding what they were talking about. I said, well, I should learn this language too. So I did. And then later met my spouse and Italian became a part of my life. But I go to China a lot these days. I go to Asia, I go to Europe and every time I go, I kind of am amazed by the richness of human experience and the people don't have any idea if you haven't traveled, kind of how amazingly rich and I love the diversity. It's not just a buzzword to me. It really means something. I love to embed myself with other people's experiences. And so yeah, learning language is a big part of that. I think I've said in some interview at some point that if I had millions of dollars and infinite time or whatever, what would you really work on if you really wanted to do AI? And for me, that is natural language and really done right. Deep understanding of language. That's to me, an amazingly interesting scientific challenge. One we're very far away on. One we're very far away, but good natural language. People are kind of really invested then. I think a lot of them see that's where the core of AI is that if you understand that you really help human communication, you understand something about the human mind, the semantics that come out of the human mind and I agree, I think that will be such a long time. So I didn't do that in my career just cause I kind of, I was behind in the early days. I didn't kind of know enough of that stuff. I was at MIT, I didn't learn much language and it was too late at some point to kind of spend a whole career doing that, but I admire that field and so in my little way by learning language, you know, kind of that part of my brain has been trained up. Jan was right. You truly are the Miles Davis of machine learning. I don't think there's a better place than it. Mike it was a huge honor talking to you today. Merci beaucoup. All right.

And now let me leave you with some words of wisdom from Michael I. Jordan from his blog post titled Artificial Intelligence, the revolution hasn't happened yet, calling for broadening the scope of the AI field. We should embrace the fact that what we are witnessing is the creation of a new branch of engineering. The term engineering is often invoked in a narrow sense in academia and beyond with overtones of cold, effectless machinery and negative connotations of loss of control by humans. But an engineering discipline can be what we want it to be. In the current era, we have a real opportunity to conceive of something historically new, a human centric engineering discipline. I will resist giving this emerging discipline a name, but if the acronym AI continues to be used, let's be aware of the very real limitations of this placeholder. Let's broaden our scope, tone down the hype, and recognize the serious challenges ahead. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time. you say is the most interesting disagreement you have with Jan Lacune? So Jan's an old friend and I just say that I don't think we disagree about very much really. He and I both kind of have a let's build it kind of mentality and does it work kind of mentality and kind of concrete. We both speak French and we speak French more together and we have a lot in common. And so if one wanted to highlight a disagreement, it's not really a fundamental one. I think it's just kind of what we're emphasizing. Jan has emphasized pattern recognition and has emphasized prediction. And it's interesting to try to take that as far as you can. If you could do perfect prediction, what would that give you kind of as a thought experiment? And I think that's way too limited. We cannot do perfect prediction. We will never have the data sets that allow me to figure out what you're about ready to do, what question you're going to ask next. I have no clue. I will never know such things. Moreover, most of us find ourselves during the day in all kinds of situations we had no anticipation of that are kind of very, very novel in various ways. And in that moment, we want to think through what we want. And also there's going to be market forces acting on us. I'd like to go down that street, but now it's full because there's a crane in the street. I got it. I got to think about that. I got to think about what I might really want here. And I got to sort of think about how much it costs me to do this action versus this action. I got to think about the risks involved. A lot of our current pattern recognition and prediction systems don't do any risk evaluations. They have no error bars, right? I got to think about other people's decisions around me. I got to think about a collection of my decisions, even just thinking about like a medical treatment, you know, I'm not going to take a, the prediction of a neural net about my health, about something consequential. I'm not about ready to have a heart attack because some number is over 0.7. Even if you had all the data in the world that ever been collected about heart attacks better than any doctor ever had, I'm not going to trust the output of that neural net to predict my heart attack. I'm going to want to ask what if questions around that. I'm going to want to look at some us or other possible data I didn't have, causal things. I'm going to want to have a dialogue with a doctor about things we didn't think about when he gathered the data. You know, I could go on and on. I hope you can see. And I don't, I think that if you say predictions, everything that, that, that you're missing all of this stuff. And so prediction plus decision making is everything, but both of them are equally important. And so the field has emphasized prediction, Jan rightly so has seen how powerful that is. But at the cost of people not being aware that decision making is where the rubber really hits the road, where human lives are at stake, where risks are being taken, where you got to gather more data. You got to think about the error bars. You got to think about the consequences of your decisions on others. You got to think about the economy around your decisions, blah, blah, blah, blah. I'm not the only one working on those, but we're a smaller tribe. And right now we're not the one that people talk about the most. But you know, if you go out in the real world and industry, you know, at Amazon, I'd say half the people there are working on decision making and the other half are doing, you know, the pattern recognition. It's important. And the words of pattern recognition and prediction, I think the distinction there, not to linger on words, but the distinction there is more a constrained sort of in the lab data set versus decision making is talking about consequential decisions in the real world, under the messiness and the uncertainty of the real world. And just the whole of it, the whole mess of it that actually touches human beings and scale. And the forces, that's the distinction. It helps add those, that perspective, that broader perspective. You're right. I totally agree. On the other hand, if you're a real prediction person, of course, you want it to be in the real world. You want to predict real world events. I'm just saying that's not possible with just data sets. That it has to be in the context of, you know, strategic things that someone's doing, data they might gather, things they could have gathered, the reasoning process around data. It's not just taking data and making predictions based on the data. So one of the things that you're working on, I'm sure there's others working on it, but I don't hear often it talked about, especially in the clarity that you talk about it, and I think it's both the most exciting and the most concerning area of AI in terms of decision making. So you've talked about AI systems that help make decisions that scale in a distributed way, millions, billions decisions, sort of markets of decisions. Can you, as a starting point, sort of give an example of a system that you think about when you're thinking about these kinds of systems? Yeah, so first of all, you're absolutely getting into some territory, which I will be beyond my expertise. And there are lots of things that are going to be very not obvious to think about. Just like, again, I like to think about history a little bit, but think about put yourself back in the sixties. There was kind of a banking system that wasn't computerized really. There was database theory emerging and database people had to think about how do I actually not just move data around, but actual money and have it be, you know, valid and have transactions that ATMs happen that are actually, you know, all valid and so on and so forth. So that's the kind of issues you get into when you start to get serious about sorts of things like this. I like to think about as kind of almost a thought experiment to help me think something simpler, which is the music market. And because there is, to first order, there is no music market in the world right now and in our country, for sure. There are something called things called record companies and they make money and they prop up a few really good musicians and make them superstars and they all make huge amounts of money. But there's a long tail of huge numbers of people that make lots and lots of really good music that is actually listened to by more people than the famous people. They are not in a market. They cannot have a career. They do not make money. The creators, the creators, the creators, the so called influencers or whatever that diminishes who they are. So there are people who make extremely good music, especially in the hip hop or Latin world these days. They do it on their laptop. That's what they do on the weekend and they have another job during the week and they put it up on SoundCloud or other sites. Eventually it gets streamed. It now gets turned into bits. It's not economically valuable. The information is lost. It gets put up there. People stream it. You walk around in a big city, you see people with headphones, especially young kids listening to music all the time. If you look at the data, very little of the music they are listening to is the famous people's music and none of it's old music. It's all the latest stuff. But the people who made that latest stuff are like some 16 year old somewhere who will never make a career out of this, who will never make money. Of course there will be a few counter examples. The record companies incentivize to pick out a few and highlight them. Long story short, there's a missing market there. There is not a consumer producer relationship at the level of the actual creative acts. The pipelines and Spotify's of the world that take this stuff and stream it along, they make money off of subscriptions or advertising and those things. They're making the money. All right. And then they will offer bits and pieces of it to a few people again to highlight that they simulate a market. Anyway, a real market would be if you're a creator of music that you actually are somebody who's good enough that people want to listen to you, you should have the data available to you. There should be a dashboard showing a map of the United States. So in last week, here's all the places your songs were listened to. It should be transparent, vetable, so that if someone down in Providence sees that you're being listened to 10,000 times in Providence, that they know that's real data. You know it's real data. They will have you come give a show down there. They will broadcast to the people who've been listening to you that you're coming. If you do this right, you could go down there and make $20,000. You do that three times a year, you start to have a career. So in this sense, AI creates jobs. It's not about taking away human jobs. It's creating new jobs because it creates a new market. Once you've created a market, you've now connected up producers and consumers. The person who's making the music can say to someone who comes to their shows a lot, hey, I'll play at your daughter's wedding for $10,000. You'll say 8,000. They'll say 9,000. Then again, you can now get an income up to $100,000. You're not going to be a millionaire. And now even think about really the value of music is in these personal connections, even so much so that a young kid wants to wear a tshirt with their favorite musician's signature on it. So if they listen to the music on the internet, the internet should be able to provide them with a button that they push and the merchandise arrives the next day. We can do that. And now why should we do that? Well, because the kid who bought the shirt will be happy, but more the person who made the music will get the money. There's no advertising needed. So you can create markets between producers and consumers, take 5% cut. Your company will be perfectly sound. It'll go forward into the future and it will create new markets and that raises human happiness. Now this seems like, well, this is easy, just create this dashboard, kind of create some connections and all that. But if you think about Uber or whatever, you think about the challenges in the real world of doing things like this, and there are actually new principles going to be needed. You're trying to create a new kind of two way market at a different scale that's ever been done before. There's going to be unwanted aspects of the market. There'll be bad people. There'll be the data will get used in the wrong ways, it'll fail in some ways, it won't deliver about. You have to think that through. Just like anyone who ran a big auction or ran a big matching service in economics will think these things through. And so that maybe doesn't get at all the huge issues that can arise when you start to create markets, but it starts to, at least for me, solidify my thoughts and allow me to move forward in my own thinking. Yeah. So I talked to the head of research at Spotify actually, and I think their longterm goal, they've said, is to have at least one million creators make a comfortable living putting on Spotify. So I think you articulate a really nice vision of the world and the digital and the cyberspace of markets. What do you think companies like Spotify or YouTube or Netflix can do to create such markets? Is it an AI problem? Is it an interface problem for interface design? Is it some other kind of, is it an economics problem? Who should they hire to solve these problems? Well, part of it's not just top down. So the Silicon Valley has this attitude that they know how to do it. They will create the system just like Google did with the search box that will be so good that they'll just, everyone will adopt that. It's everything you said, but really I think missing that kind of culture. So it's literally that 16 year old who's able to create the songs. You don't create that as a Silicon Valley entity. You don't hire them per se. You have to create an ecosystem in which they are wanted and that they belong. And so you have to have some cultural credibility to do things like this. Netflix, to their credit, wanted some of that credibility and they created shows, content. They call it content. It's such a terrible word, but it's culture. And so with movies, you can kind of go give a large sum of money to somebody graduating from the USC film school. It's a whole thing of its own, but it's kind of like rich white people's thing to do. And American culture has not been so much about rich white people. It's been about all the immigrants, all the Africans who came and brought that culture and those rhythms to this world and created this whole new thing. American culture. And so companies can't artificially create that. They can't just say, hey, we're here. We're going to buy it up. You've got a partner. And so anyway, not to denigrate, these companies are all trying and they should, and I'm sure they're asking these questions and some of them are even making an effort. But it is partly a respect the culture as a technology person. You've got to blend your technology with cultural meaning. How much of a role do you think the algorithm, so machine learning has in connecting the consumer to the creator, sort of the recommender system aspect of this? Yeah. It's a great question. I think pretty high. There's no magic in the algorithms, but a good recommender system is way better than a bad recommender system. And recommender systems is a billion dollar industry back even 10, 20 years ago. And it continues to be extremely important going forward. What's your favorite recommender system, just so we can put something, well, just historically I was one of the, when I first went to Amazon, I first didn't like Amazon because they put the book people out of business or the library, the local booksellers went out of business. I've come to accept that there probably are more books being sold now and poor people reading them than ever before. And then local book stores are coming back. So that's how economics sometimes work. You go up and you go down. But anyway, when I finally started going there and I bought a few books, I was really pleased to see another few books being recommended to me that I never would have thought of. And I bought a bunch of them. So they obviously had a good business model. But I learned things and I still to this day kind of browse using that service. And I think lots of people get a lot, that is a good aspect of a recommendation system. I'm learning from my peers in an indirect way. And their algorithms are not meant to have them impose what we learn. It really is trying to find out what's in the data. It doesn't work so well for other kinds of entities, but that's just the complexity of human life. Like shirts, I'm not going to get recommendations on shirts, but that's interesting. If you try to recommend restaurants, it's hard. It's hard to do it at scale. But a blend of recommendation systems with other economic ideas, matchings and so on is really, really still very open research wise. And there's new companies that are going to emerge that do that well. What do you think is going to the messy, difficult land of say politics and things like that, that YouTube and Twitter have to deal with in terms of recommendation systems? Being able to suggest, I think Facebook just launched Facebook news. So recommend the kind of news that are most likely for you to be interesting. Do you think this is AI solvable, again, whatever term we want to use, do you think it's a solvable problem for machines or is it a deeply human problem that's unsolvable? So I don't even think about it at that level. I think that what's broken with some of these companies, it's all monetization by advertising. They're not, at least Facebook, I want to critique them, but they didn't really try to connect a producer and a consumer in an economic way, right? No one wants to pay for anything. And so they all, you know, starting with Google and Facebook, they went back to the playbook of, you know, the television companies back in the day. No one wanted to pay for this signal. They will pay for the TV box, but not for the signal, at least back in the day. And so advertising kind of filled that gap and advertising was new and interesting and it somehow didn't take over our lives quite, right? Fast forward, Google provides a service that people don't want to pay for. And so somewhat surprisingly in the nineties, they made, they ended up making huge amounts so they cornered the advertising market. It didn't seem like that was going to happen, at least to me. These little things on the right hand side of the screen just did not seem all that economically interesting, but that companies had maybe no other choice. The TV market was going away and billboards and so on. So they've, they got it. And I think that sadly that Google just has, it was doing so well with that at making such money. They didn't think much more about how, wait a minute, is there a producer consumer relationship to be set up here? Not just between us and the advertisers market to be created. Is there an actual market between the producer consumer? They're the producers, the person who created that video clip, the person that made that website, the person who could make more such things, the person who could adjust it as a function of demand, the person on the other side who's asking for different kinds of things, you know? So you see glimmers of that now there's influencers and there's kind of a little glimmering of a market, but it should have been done 20 years ago. It should have been thought about. It should have been created in parallel with the advertising ecosystem. And then Facebook inherited that. And I think they also didn't think very much about that. So fast forward and now they are making huge amounts of money off of advertising. And the news thing and all these clicks is just feeding the advertising. It's all connected up to the advertiser. So you want more people to click on certain things because that money flows to you, Facebook. You're very much incentivized to do that. And when you start to find it's breaking, people are telling you, well, we're getting into some troubles. You try to adjust it with your smart AI algorithms, right? And figure out what are bad clicks. So maybe it shouldn't be click through rate, it should be something else. I find that pretty much hopeless. It does get into all the complexity of human life and you can try to fix it. You should, but you could also fix the whole business model. And the business model is that really, what are, are there some human producers and consumers out there? Is there some economic value to be liberated by connecting them directly? Is it such that it's so valuable that people will be able to pay for it? All right. And micro payments, like small payments. Micro, but even have to be micro. So I like the example, suppose I'm going, next week I'm going to India. Never been to India before. Right? I have a couple of days in Mumbai, I have no idea what to do there. Right? And I could go on the web right now and search. It's going to be kind of hopeless. I'm not going to find, you know, I have lots of advertisers in my face. Right? What I really want to do is broadcast to the world that I am going to Mumbai and have someone on the other side of a market look at me and, and there's a recommendation system there. So I'm not looking at all possible people coming to Mumbai. They're looking at the people who are relevant to them. So someone in my age group, someone who kind of knows me in some level, I give up a little privacy by that, but I'm happy because what I'm going to get back is this person can make a little video for me, or they're going to write a little two page paper on here's the cool things that you want to do and move by this week, especially, right? I'm going to look at that. I'm not going to pay a micro payment. I'm going to pay, you know, a hundred dollars or whatever for that. It's real value. It's like journalism. Um, and as an honest subscription, it's that I'm going to pay that person in that moment. Company's going to take 5% of that. And that person has now got it. It's a gig economy, if you will, but you know, done for it, you know, thinking about a little bit behind YouTube, there was actually people who could make more of those things. If they were connected to a market, they would make more of those things independently. You don't have to tell them what to do. You don't have to incentivize them any other way. Um, and so, yeah, these companies, I don't think have thought long and hard about that. So I do distinguish on Facebook on the one side, who just not thought about these things at all. I think, uh, thinking that AI will fix everything, uh, and Amazon thinks about them all the time because they were already out in the real world. They were delivering packages, people's doors. They were, they were worried about a market. They were worried about sellers and, you know, they worry and some things they do are great. Some things maybe not so great, but you know, they're in that business model. And then I'd say Google sort of hovers somewhere in between. I don't, I don't think for a long, long time they got it. I think they probably see that YouTube is more pregnant with possibility than, than, than they might've thought and that they're probably heading that direction. Um, but uh, you know, Silicon Valley has been dominated by the Google Facebook kind of mentality and the subscription and advertising and that is, that's the core problem, right? The fake news actually rides on top of that because it means that you're monetizing with clip through rate and that is the core problem. You got to remove that. So advertisement, if we're going to linger on that, I mean, that's an interesting thesis. I don't know if everyone really deeply thinks about that. So you're right. The thought is the advertising model is the only thing we have, the only thing we'll ever have. We have to fix, we have to build algorithms that despite that business model, you know, find the better angels of our nature and do good by society and by the individual. But you think we can slowly, you think, first of all, there's a difference between should and could. So you're saying we should slowly move away from the advertising model and have a direct connection between the consumer and the creator. The question I also have is, can we, because the advertising model is so successful now in terms of just making a huge amount of money and therefore being able to build a big company that provides, has really smart people working that create a good service. Do you think it's possible? And just to clarify, you think we should move away? Well, I think we should. Yeah. But we is the, you know, me. So society. Yeah. Well, the companies, I mean, so first of all, full disclosure, I'm doing a day a week at Amazon because I kind of want to learn more about how they do things. So, you know, I'm not speaking for Amazon in any way, but, you know, I did go there because I actually believe they get a little bit of this or trying to create these markets. And they don't really use, advertising is not a crucial part of it. Well, that's a good question. So it has become not crucial, but it's become more and more present if you go to Amazon website. And, you know, without revealing too many deep secrets about Amazon, I can tell you that, you know, a lot of people in the company question this and there's a huge questioning going on. You do not want a world where there's zero advertising. That actually is a bad world. Okay. So here's a way to think about it. You're a company that like Amazon is trying to bring products to customers, right? And the customer, at any given moment, you want to buy a vacuum cleaner, say, you want to know what's available for me. And, you know, it's not going to be that obvious. You have to do a little bit of work at it. The recommendation system will sort of help, right? But now suppose this other person over here has just made the world, you know, they spent a huge amount of energy. They had a great idea. They made a great vacuum cleaner. They know they really did it. They nailed it. It's an MIT, you know, whiz kid that made a great new vacuum cleaner, right? It's not going to be in the recommendation system. No one will know about it. The algorithms will not find it and AI will not fix that. Okay. At all. Right. How do you allow that vacuum cleaner to start to get in front of people, be sold well advertising. And here, what advertising is, it's a signal that you're, you believe in your product enough that you're willing to pay some real money for it. And to me as a consumer, I look at that signal. I say, well, first of all, I know these are not just cheap little ads cause we have now right now there. I know that, you know, these are super cheap, you know, pennies. If I see an ad where it's actually, I know the company is only doing a few of these and they're making, you know, real money is kind of flowing and I see an ad, I may pay more attention to it. And I actually might want that because I see, Hey, that guy spent money on his vacuum cleaner. Maybe there's something good there. So I will look at it. And so that's part of the overall information flow in a good market. So advertising has a role, but the problem is of course that that signal is now completely gone because it just, you know, dominant by these tiny little things that add up to big money for the company, you know? So I think it will just, I think it will change because the societies just don't, you know, stick with things that annoy a lot of people and advertising currently annoys people more than it provides information. And I think that a Google probably is smart enough to figure out that this is a dead, this is a bad model, even though it's a hard, huge amount of money and they'll have to figure out how to pull it away from it slowly. And I'm sure the CEO there will figure it out, but they need to do it. And they needed it to, so if you reduce advertising, not to zero, but you reduce it at the same time you bring up producer, consumer, actual real value being delivered. So real money is being paid and they take a 5% cut that 5% could start to get big enough to cancel out the lost revenue from the kind of the poor kind of advertising. And I think that a good company will do that, will realize that. And Facebook, you know, again, God bless them. They bring, you know, grandmothers, they bring children's pictures into grandmothers lives. It's fantastic. But they need to think of a new business model and that's the core problem there. Until they start to connect producer consumer, I think they will just continue to make money and then buy the next social network company and then buy the next one and the innovation level will not be high and the health issues will not go away. So I apologize that we kind of returned to words, I don't think the exact terms matter, but in sort of defense of advertisement, don't you think the kind of direct connection between consumer and creator producer is what advertisement strives to do, right? So that is best advertisement is literally now Facebook is listening to our conversation and heard that you're going to India and will be able to actually start automatically for you making these connections and start giving this offer. So like, I apologize if it's just a matter of terms, but just to draw a distinction, is it possible to make advertisements just better and better and better algorithmically to where it actually becomes a connection, almost a direct connection? That's a good question. So let's component on that. First of all, what we just talked about, I was defending advertising. Okay. So I was defending it as a way to get signals into a market that don't come any other way, especially algorithmically. It's a sign that someone spent money on it, it's a sign they think it's valuable. And if I think that if other things, someone else thinks it's valuable, and if I trust other people, I might be willing to listen. I don't trust that Facebook though, who's an intermediary between this. I don't think they care about me. Okay. I don't think they do. And I find it creepy that they know I'm going to India next week because of our conversation. Why do you think that is? So what, could you just put your PR hat on? Why do you think you find Facebook creepy and not trust them as do majority of the population? So they're out of the Silicon Valley companies, I saw like not approval rate, but there's ranking of how much people trust companies and Facebook is in the gutter. In the gutter, including people inside of Facebook. So what do you attribute that to? Because when I... Come on, you don't find it creepy that right now we're talking that I might walk out on the street right now that some unknown person who I don't know kind of comes up to me and says, I hear you're going to India. I mean, that's not even Facebook. That's just, I want transparency in human society. I want to have, if you know something about me, there's actually some reason you know something about me. That's something that if I look at it later and audit it kind of, I approve. You know something about me because you care in some way. There's a caring relationship even, or an economic one or something. Not just that you're someone who could exploit it in ways I don't know about or care about or I'm troubled by or whatever. We're in a world right now where that happens way too much and that Facebook knows things about a lot of people and could exploit it and does exploit it at times. I think most people do find that creepy. It's not for them. It's not that Facebook is not doing it because they care about them in a real sense. And they shouldn't. They should not be a big brother caring about us. That is not the role of a company like that. Why not? Wait, not the big brother part, but the caring, the trusting. I mean, don't those companies, just to link on it because a lot of companies have a lot of information about us. I would argue that there's companies like Microsoft that has more information about us than Facebook does and yet we trust Microsoft more. Well, Microsoft is pivoting. Microsoft, you know, under Satya Nadella has decided this is really important. We don't want to do creepy things. Really want people to trust us to actually only use information in ways that they really would approve of, that we don't decide, right? And I'm just kind of adding that the health of a market is that when I connect to someone who produces a consumer, it's not just a random producer or consumer, it's people who see each other. They don't like each other, but they sense that if they transact, some happiness will go up on both sides. If a company helps me to do that in moments that I choose of my choosing, then fine. So, and also think about the difference between, you know, browsing versus buying, right? There are moments in my life I just want to buy, you know, a gadget or something. I need something for that moment. I need some ammonia for my house or something because I got a problem with a spill. I want to just go in. I don't want to be advertised at that moment. I don't want to be led down various, you know, that's annoying. I want to just go and have it be extremely easy to do what I want. Other moments I might say, no, it's like today I'm going to the shopping mall. I want to walk around and see things and see people and be exposed to stuff. So I want control over that though. I don't want the company's algorithms to decide for me, right? I think that's the thing. There's a total loss of control if Facebook thinks they should take the control from us of deciding when we want to have certain kinds of information, when we don't, what information that is, how much it relates to what they know about us that we didn't really want them to know about us. I don't want them to be helping me in that way. I don't want them to be helping them by they decide they have control over what I want and when. I totally agree. Facebook, by the way, I have this optimistic thing where I think Facebook has the kind of personal information about us that could create a beautiful thing. So I'm really optimistic of what Facebook could do. It's not what it's doing, but what it could do. So I don't see that. I think that optimism is misplaced because there's not a bit, you have to have a business model behind these things. Create a beautiful thing is really, let's be, let's be clear. It's about something that people would value. And I don't think they have that business model and I don't think they will suddenly discover it by what, you know, a long hot shower. I disagree. I disagree in terms of, you can discover a lot of amazing things in a shower. So I didn't say that. I said, they won't come, they won't do it, but in the shower, I think a lot of other people will discover it. I think that this guy, so I should also, full disclosure, there's a company called United Masters, which I'm on their board and they've created this music market and I have a hundred thousand artists now signed on and they've done things like gone to the NBA and the NBA, the music you find behind NBA clips right now is their music, right? That's a company that had the right business model in mind from the get go, right? Executed on that. And from day one, there was value brought to, so here you have a kid who made some songs who suddenly their songs are on the NBA website, right? That's real economic value to people. And so, you know, so you and I differ on the optimism of being able to sort of change the direction of the Titanic, right? So I, yeah, I'm older than you, so I've seen some Titanic's crash, got it. But and just to elaborate, cause I totally agree with you and I just want to know how difficult you think this problem is of, so for example, I want to read some news and I would, there's a lot of times in the day where something makes me either smile or think in a way where I like consciously think this really gave me value. Like I sometimes listen to the daily podcasts in the New York times, way better than the New York times themselves, by the way, for people listening. That's like real journalism is happening for some reason in the podcast space. It doesn't make sense to me, but often I listen to it 20 minutes and I would be willing to pay for that, like $5, $10 for that experience. And how difficult, that's kind of what you're getting at is that little transaction. How difficult is it to create a frictionless system like Uber has, for example, for other things? What's your intuition there? So I, first of all, I pay little bits of money to, you know, to send, there's something called courts that does financial things. I like medium as a site, I don't pay there, but I would. You had a great post on medium. I would have loved to pay you a dollar and not others. I wouldn't have wanted it per se because there should be also sites where that's not actually the goal. The goal is to actually have a broadcast channel that I monetize in some other way if I chose to. I mean, I could now people know about it. I could, I'm not doing it, but that's fine with me. Also the musicians who are making all this music, I don't think the right model is that you pay a little subscription fee to them, right? Because people can copy the bits too easily and it's just not that somewhere the value is. The value is that a connection was made between real human beings, then you can follow up on that. All right. And create yet more value. So no, I think there's a lot of open questions here, hot open questions, but also, yeah, I do want good recommendation systems that recommend cool stuff to me. But it's pretty hard, right? I don't like them to recommend stuff just based on my browsing history. I don't like the based on stuff they know about me, quote unquote. What's unknown about me is the most interesting. So this is the, this is the really interesting question. We may disagree, maybe not. I think that I love recommender systems and I want to give them everything about me in a way that I trust. Yeah. But you, but you don't, because, so for example, this morning I clicked on a, you know, I was pretty sleepy this morning. I clicked on a story about the queen of England. Yes. Right. I do not give a damn about the queen of England. I really do not. But it was clickbait. It kind of looked funny and I had to say, what the heck are they talking about? I don't want to have my life, you know, heading that direction. Now that's in my browsing history. The system in any reasonable system will think that I care about the queen of England. That's browsing history. Right. But, but you're saying all the trace, all the digital exhaust or whatever, that's been kind of the models. If you collect all this stuff, you're going to figure all of us out. Well, if you're trying to figure out like kind of one person like Trump or something, maybe you could figure him out. But if you're trying to figure out, you know, 500 million people, you know, no way, no way. You think so? No, I do. I think so. I think we are, humans are just amazingly rich and complicated. Every one of us has our little quirks, every one of us has our little things that could intrigue us that we don't even know it will intrigue us. And there's no sign of it in our past, but by God, there it comes and you know, you fall in love with it. And I don't want a company trying to figure that out for me and anticipate that I want them to provide a forum, a market, a place that I kind of go and by hook or by crook, this happens, you know, I I'm walking down the street and I hear some Chilean music being played and I never knew I liked Chilean music, but wow. So there is that side and I want them to provide a limited, but you know, interesting place to go. Right. And so don't try to use your AI to kind of, you know, figure me out and then put me in a world where you figured me out, you know, no, create huge spaces for human beings where our creativity and our style will be enriched and come forward and it'll be a lot of more transparency. I won't have people randomly, anonymously putting comments up and I'll special based on stuff they know about me, facts that, you know, we are so broken right now. If you're, you know, especially if you're a celebrity, but you know, it's about anybody that anonymous people are hurting lots and lots of people right now. That's part of this thing that Silicon Valley is thinking that, you know, just collect all this information and use it in a great way. So no, I'm not, I'm not a pessimist, I'm very much an optimist by nature, but I think that's just been the wrong path for the whole technology to take. Be more limited, create, let humans rise up. Don't try to replace them. That's the AI mantra. Don't try to anticipate them. Don't try to predict them because you're, you're, you're not going to, you're not going to be able to do those things. You're going to make things worse. Okay. So right now, just give this a chance. Right now, the recommender systems are the creepy people in the shadow watching your every move. So they're looking at traces of you. They're not directly interacting with you, sort of the, your close friends and family, the way they know you is by having conversation, by actually having interactions back and forth. Do you think there's a place for recommender systems sort of to step, cause you, you just emphasize the value of human to human connection, but yeah, just give it a chance, AI human connection. Is there a role for an AI system to have conversations with you in terms of, to try to figure out what kind of music you like, not by just watching what you listening to, but actually having a conversation, natural language or otherwise. Yeah, no, I'm, I'm, so I'm not against it. I just wanted to push back against the, maybe you're saying you have options for Facebook. So there I think it's misplaced, but, but I think that distributing, yeah, no, so good for you. Go for it. That's a hard spot to be in. Yeah, no, good. Human interaction, like on our daily, the context around me in my own home is something that I don't want some big company to know about at all, but I would be more than happy to have technology help me with it. Which kind of technology? Well, you know, just, Alexa, Amazon, well, a good, Alexa's done right. And I think Alexa is a research platform right now more than anything else. But Alexa done right, you know, could do things like I, I leave the water running in my garden and I say, Hey, Alexa, the water's running in my garden. And even have Alexa figure out that that means when my wife comes home, that she should be told about that. That's a little bit of a reasoning. I would call that AI and by any kind of stretch, it's a little bit of reasoning and it actually kind of would make my life a little easier and better. And you know, I don't, I wouldn't call this a wow moment, but I kind of think that overall rises human happiness up to have that kind of thing. But not when you're lonely, Alexa, knowing loneliness. No, no, I don't want Alexa to be, feel intrusive. And I don't want just the designer of the system to kind of work all this out. I really want to have a lot of control and I want transparency and control. And if a company can stand up and give me that in the context of new technology, I think they're good. First of all, be way more successful than our current generation. And like I said, I was mentioning Microsoft, I really think they're, they're pivoting to kind of be the trusted old uncle, but you know, I think that they get that this is a way to go, that if you let people find technology, empowers them to have more control and have and have control, not just over privacy, but over this rich set of interactions, that that people are going to like that a lot more. And that's, that's the right business model going forward. What does control over privacy look like? Do you think you should be able to just view all the data that? No, it's much more than that. I mean, first of all, it should be an individual decision. Some people don't want privacy. They want their whole life out there. Other people's want it. Privacy is not a zero one. It's not a legal thing. It's not just about which data is available, which is not. I like to recall to people that, you know, a couple hundred years ago, everyone, there was not really big cities, everyone lived in on the countryside and villages and villages. Everybody knew everything about you. Very, you didn't have any privacy. Is that bad? Are we better off now? Well, you know, arguably no, because what did you get for that loss of certain kinds of privacy? Well, people help each other if they, because they know everything about you. They know something's bad's happening, they will help you with that. Right. And now you live in a big city, no one knows about that. You get no help. So it kind of depends the answer. I want certain people who I trust and there should be relationships. I should kind of manage all those, but who knows what about me? I should have some agency there. It shouldn't, I shouldn't be a drift in a sea of technology where I have no agency. I don't want to go reading things and checking boxes. So I don't know how to do that. And I'm not a privacy researcher per se. I just, I recognize the vast complexity of this. It's not just technology. It's not just legal scholars meeting technologists. There's gotta be kind of a whole layers around it. And so I, when I alluded to this emerging engineering field, this is a big part of it. When electrical engineering came, I'm not one around at the time, but you just didn't plug electricity into walls and all kinds of work. You don't have to have like underwriters laboratory that reassured you that that plug's not going to burn up your house and that that machine will do this and that and everything. There'll be whole people who can install things. There'll be people who can watch the installers. There'll be a whole layers, you know, an onion of these kinds of things. And for things as deep and interesting as privacy, which is as least as interesting as electricity, that's going to take decades to kind of work out, but it's going to require a lot of new structures that we don't have right now. So it's kind of hard to talk about it. And you're saying there's a lot of money to be made if you get it right. So something you should look at. A lot of money to be made in all these things that provide human services and people recognize them as useful parts of their lives. So yeah. So yeah, the dialogue sometimes goes from the exuberant technologists to the no technology is good, kind of. And that's, you know, in our public discourse, you know, and as far as you see too much of this kind of thing and the sober discussions in the middle, which are the challenge he wants to have or where we need to be having our conversations. And you know, there's just not actually, there's not many forum fora for those. You know, there's, that's, that's kind of what I would look for. Maybe I could go and I could read a comment section of something and it would actually be this kind of dialogue going back and forth. You don't see much of this, right? Which is why actually there's a resurgence of podcasts out of all, because people are really hungry for conversation, but there's technology is not helping much. So comment sections of anything, including YouTube is not hurting and not helping.\",\n          \"We are becoming cyborgs. Our brains are fundamentally changed. Everyone who grew up with electronics, we are fundamentally different from previous, from homo sapiens. I call us homo techno. I think we have evolved into homo techno, which is like essentially a new species. Previous technologies, I mean, may have even been more profound and moved us to a certain degree, but I think the computers are what make us homo techno. I think this is what, it's a brain augmentation. So it like allows for actual evolution. Like the computers accelerate the degree to which all the other technologies can also be accelerated. Would you classify yourself as a homo sapien or a homo techno? Definitely homo techno. So you're one of the earliest of the species. I think most of us are. The following is a conversation with Grimes, an artist, musician, songwriter, producer, director, and a fascinating human being who thinks a lot about both the history and the future of human civilization. Studying the dark periods of our past to help form an optimistic vision of our future. This is the Lex Friedman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Grimes. Oh yeah, the cloud lifter, there you go. There you go. You know your stuff. Have you ever used a cloud lifter? Yeah, I actually, this microphone cloud lifter is what Michael Jackson used, so. No, really? Yeah, this is like Thriller and stuff. This mic and a cloud lifter? Yeah, it's a incredible microphone. It's very flattering on vocals. I've used this a lot. It's great for demo vocals. It's great in a room. Sometimes it's easier to record vocals if you're just in a room and the music's playing and you just wanna feel it so it's not in the headphones. And this mic is pretty directional, so I think it's a good mic for just vibing out and just getting a real good vocal take. Just vibing, just in a room. Anyway, this is the Michael Jackson, Quincy Jones microphone. I feel way more badass now. All right, you wanna just get into it? I guess so. All right, one of your names, at least in this space and time, is C, like the letter C. And you told me that C means a lot of things. It's the speed of light. It's the render rate of the universe. It's yes in Spanish. It's the crescent moon. And it happens to be my favorite programming language because it basically runs the world, but it's also powerful, fast, and it's dangerous because you can mess things up really bad with it because of all the pointers. But anyway, which of these associations will the name C is the coolest to you? I mean, to me, the coolest is the speed of light, obviously, or the speed of light. When I say render rate of the universe, I think I mean the speed of light because essentially that's what we're rendering at. See, I think we'll know if we're in a simulation if the speed of light changes because if they can improve their render speed, then. Well, it's already pretty good. It's already pretty good, but if it improves, then we'll know, we can probably be like, okay, they've updated or upgraded. Well, it's fast enough for us humans because it seems immediate. There's no delay, there's no latency in terms of us humans on Earth interacting with things. But if you're like intergalactic species operating on a much larger scale, then you're gonna start noticing some weird stuff. Or if you can operate in like around a black hole, then you're gonna start to see some render issues. You can't go faster than the speed of light, correct? So it really limits our ability or one's ability to travel space. Theoretically, you can, you have wormholes. So there's nothing in general relativity that precludes faster than the speed of light travel. But it just seems you're gonna have to do some really funky stuff with very heavy things that have like weirdnesses, that have basically terrors in space time. We don't know how to do that. Do navigators know how to do it? Do navigators? Yeah. Folding space, basically making wormholes. So the name C. Yes. Who are you? Do you think of yourself as multiple people? Are you one person? Do you know, like in this morning, were you a different person than you are tonight? We are, I should say, recording this basically at midnight, which is awesome. Yes, thank you so much. I think I'm about eight hours late. No, you're right on time. Good morning. This is the beginning of a new day soon. Anyway, are you the same person you were in the morning and the evening? Is there multiple people in there? Do you think of yourself as one person? Or maybe you have no clue? Or are you just a giant mystery to yourself? Okay, these are really intense questions, but. Let's go, let's go. Because I asked this myself, like look in the mirror, who are you? People tell you to just be yourself, but what does that even mean? I mean, I think my personality changes with everyone I talk to. So I have a very inconsistent personality. Yeah. Person to person, so the interaction, your personality materializes. Or my mood. Like I'll go from being like a megalomaniac to being like, you know, just like a total hermit who is very shy. So some combinatorial combination of your mood and the person you're interacting with. Yeah, mood and people I'm interacting with. But I think everyone's like that. Maybe not. Well, not everybody acknowledges it and able to introspect it. Who brings out, what kind of person, what kind of mood brings out the best in you? As an artist and as a human. Can you introspect this? Like my best friends, like people I can, when I'm like super confident and I know that they're gonna understand everything I'm saying, so like my best friends, then when I can start being really funny, that's always my like peak mode. But it's like, yeah, takes a lot to get there. Let's talk about constraints. You've talked about constraints and limits. Do those help you out as an artist or as a human being? Or do they get in the way? Do you like the constraints? So in creating music, in creating art, in living life, do you like the constraints that this world puts on you? Or do you hate them? If constraints are moving, then you're good, right? Like it's like as we are progressing with technology, we're changing the constraints of like artistic creation. You know, making video and music and stuff is getting a lot cheaper. There's constantly new technology and new software that's making it faster and easier. We have so much more freedom than we had in the 70s. Like when Michael Jackson, you know, when they recorded Thriller with this microphone, like they had to use a mixing desk and all this stuff. And like probably even get in a studio, it's probably really expensive and you have to be a really good singer and you have to know how to use like the mixing desk and everything. And now I can just, you know, make I've made a whole album on this computer. I have a lot more freedom, but then I'm also constrained in different ways because there's like literally millions more artists. It's like a much bigger playing field. It's just like, I also, I didn't learn music. I'm not a natural musician. So I don't know anything about actual music. I just know about like the computer. So I'm really kind of just like messing around and like trying things out. Well, yeah, I mean, but the nature of music is changing. So you're saying you don't know actual music, what music is changing. Music is becoming, you've talked about this, is becoming, it's like merging with technology. Yes. It's becoming something more than just like the notes on a piano. It's becoming some weird composition that requires engineering skills, programming skills, some kind of human robot interaction skills, and still some of the same things that Michael Jackson had, which is like a good ear for a good sense of taste of what's good and not the final thing when it's put together. Like you're allowed, you're enabled, empowered with a laptop to layer stuff, to start like layering insane amounts of stuff. And it's super easy to do that. I do think music production is a really underrated art form. I feel like people really don't appreciate it. When I look at publishing splits, the way that people like pay producers and stuff, it's super, producers are just deeply underrated. Like so many of the songs that are popular right now or for the last 20 years, like part of the reason they're popular is because the production is really interesting or really sick or really cool. And it's like, I don't think listeners, like people just don't really understand what music production is. It's not, it's sort of like this weird, discombobulated art form. It's not like a formal, because it's so new, there isn't like a formal training path for it. It's mostly driven by like autodidacts. Like it's like almost everyone I know who's good at production, like they didn't go to music school or anything. They just taught themselves. Are they're mostly different? Like the music producers, you know, is there some commonalities that time together or are they all just different kinds of weirdos? Cause I just, I just hung out with Rick Rubin. I don't know if you've. Yeah, I mean, Rick Rubin is like literally one of the gods of music production. Like he's one of the people who first, you know, who like made music production, you know, made the production as important as the actual lyrics or the notes. But the thing he does, which is interesting, I don't know if you can speak to that, but just hanging out with him, he seems to just sit there in silence, close his eyes and listen. It's like, he almost does nothing. And that nothing somehow gives you freedom to be the best version of yourself. So that's music production somehow too, which is like encouraging you to do less, to simplify, to like push towards minimalism. I mean, I guess, I mean, I work differently from Rick Rubin cause Rick Rubin produces for other artists, whereas like I mostly produce for myself. So it's a very different situation. I also think Rick Rubin, he's in that, I would say advanced category of producer where like you've like earned your, you can have an engineer and stuff and people like do the stuff for you. But I usually just like do stuff myself. So you're the engineer, the producer and the artist. Yeah, I guess I would say I'm in the era, like the post Rick Rubin era. Like I come from the kind of like Skrillex school of thought, which is like where you are. Yeah, the engineer, producer, artist. Like where, I mean lately, sometimes I'll work with a producer now. I'm gently sort of delicately starting to collaborate a bit more, but like I think I'm kind of from the, like the whatever 2010s explosion of things where everything became available on the computer and you kind of got this like lone wizard energy thing going. So you embraced being the loneliness. Is the loneliness somehow an engine of creativity? Like, so most of your stuff, most of your creative quote unquote genius in quotes is in the privacy of your mind. Yes, well, it was, but here's the thing. I was talking to Daniel Eck and he said, he's like most artists, they have about 10 years, like 10 good years. And then they usually stop making their like vital shit. And I feel like I'm sort of like nearing the end of my 10 years on my own. So you have to become somebody else. Now I'm like, I'm in the process of becoming somebody else and reinventing. When I work with other people, because I've never worked with other people, I find that I make like, that I'm exceptionally rejuvenated and making like some of the most vital work I've ever made. So, because I think another human brain is like one of the best tools you can possibly find. Like. It's a funny way to put it, I love it. It's like if a tool is like, you know, whatever HP plus one or like adds some like stats to your character, like another human brain will like square it instead of just like adding something. Double up the experience points, I love this. We should also mention we're playing Tavern music before this and which I love, which I first, I think I first. You had to stop the Tavern music. Yeah, because it doesn't, the audio. Okay, okay. But it makes. Yeah, it'll make the podcast annoying. Add it in post, add it in post. No one will want to listen to the podcast. They probably would, but it makes me, it reminds me like of a video game, like a role playing video game where you have experience points. There's something really joyful about wandering places like Elder Scrolls, like Skyrim, just exploring these landscapes in another world and then you get experience points and you can work on different skills and somehow you progress in life. I don't know, it's simple. It doesn't have some of the messy complexities of life and there's usually a bad guy you can fight in Skyrim. It's dragons and so on. I'm sure in Elden Ring, there's a bunch of monsters you can fight. I love that. I feel like Elden Ring, I feel like this is a good analogy to music production though because it's like, I feel like the engineers and the people creating these open worlds are, it's sort of like similar to people, to music producers where it's like this hidden archetype that like no one really understands what they do and no one really knows who they are, but they're like, it's like the artist engineer because it's like, it's both art and fairly complex engineering. Well, you're saying they don't get enough credit. Aren't you kind of changing that by becoming the person doing everything? Aren't you, isn't the engineer? Well, I mean, others have gone before me. I'm not, you know, there's like Timbaland and Skrillex and there's all these people that are like, you know, very famous for this, but I just think the general, I think people get confused about what it is and just don't really know what it is per se and it's just when I see a song, like when there's like a hit song, like I'm just trying to think of like, just going for like even just a basic pop hit, like, what's it? Like Rules by Dua Lipa or something. The production on that is actually like really crazy. I mean, the song is also great, but it's like the production is exceptionally memorable. Like, you know, and it's just like no one, I can't, I don't even know who produced that song. It's just like, isn't part of like the rhetoric of how we just discuss the creation of art. We just sort of like don't consider the music producer because I think the music producer used to be more just simply recording things. Yeah, that's interesting because when you think about movies, we talk about the actor and the actresses, but we also talk about the directors. We don't talk about like that with the music as often. The Beatles music producer was one of the first kind of guy, one of the first people sort of introducing crazy sound design into pop music. I forget his name. He has the same, I forget his name, but you know, like he was doing all the weird stuff like dropping pianos and like, yeah. Oh, to get the, yeah, yeah, yeah, to get the sound, to get the authentic sound. What about lyrics? You think those, where did they fit into how important they are? I was heartbroken to learn that Elvis didn't write his songs. I was very mad. A lot of people don't write their songs. I understand this, but. But here's the thing. I feel like there's this desire for authenticity. I used to be like really mad when like people wouldn't write or produce their music and I'd be like, that's fake. And then I realized there's all this like weird bitterness and like agronus in art about authenticity. But I had this kind of like weird realization recently where I started thinking that like art is sort of a decentralized collective thing. Like art is kind of a conversation with all the artists that have ever lived before you. You know, like it's like, you're really just sort of, it's not like anyone's reinventing the wheel here. Like you're kind of just taking, you know, thousands of years of art and like running it through your own little algorithm and then like making your interpretation of it. You just joined the conversation with all the other artists that came before. It's just a beautiful way to look at it. Like, and it's like, I feel like everyone's always like, there's all this copyright and IP and this and that or authenticity. And it's just like, I think we need to stop seeing this as this like egotistical thing of like, oh, the creative genius, the lone creative genius or this or that. Because it's like, I think art shouldn't be about that. I think art is something that sort of brings humanity together. And it's also, art is also kind of the collective memory of humans. It's like, we don't give a fuck about whatever ancient Egypt, like how much grain got sent that day and sending the records and like, you know, like who went where and, you know, how many shields needed to be produced for this. Like we just remember their art. And it's like, you know, it's like in our day to day life, there's all this stuff that seems more important than art because it helps us function and survive. But when all this is gone, like the only thing that's really gonna be left is the art. The technology will be obsolete. That's so fascinating. Like the humans will be dead. That is true. A good compression of human history is the art we've generated across the different centuries, the different millennia. So when the aliens come. When the aliens come, they're gonna find the hieroglyphics and the pyramids. I mean, art could be broadly defined. They might find like the engineering marvels, the bridges, the rockets, the. I guess I sort of classify though. Architecture is art too. I consider engineering in those formats to be art, for sure. It sucks that like digital art is easier to delete. So if there's an apocalypse, a nuclear war, that can disappear. Yes. And the physical. There's something still valuable about the physical manifestation of art. That sucks that like music, for example, has to be played by somebody. Yeah, I do think we should have a foundation type situation where we like, you know how we have like seed banks up in the north and stuff? Like we should probably have like a solar powered or geothermal little bunker that like has all human knowledge. You mentioned Daniel Ek and Spotify. What do you think about that as an artist? What's Spotify? Is that empowering? To me, Spotify as a consumer is super exciting. It makes it easy for me to access music from all kinds of artists, get to explore all kinds of music, make it super easy to sort of curate my own playlist and have fun with all that. It was so liberating to let go. You know, I used to collect, you know, albums and CDs and so on, like horde albums. Yeah. Like they matter. But the reality you could, you know, that was really liberating that I could let go of that. And letting go of the albums you're kind of collecting allows you to find new music, exploring new artists and all that kind of stuff. But I know from a perspective of an artist that could be, like you mentioned, competition could be a kind of constraint because there's more and more and more artists on the platform. I think it's better that there's more artists. I mean, again, this might be propaganda because this is all from a conversation with Daniel Ek. So this could easily be propaganda. We're all a victim of somebody's propaganda. So let's just accept this. But Daniel Ek was telling me that, you know, to understand really difficult concepts just in a very different way, like an emotional intelligence about something deep within? Oh yeah, no, like if X hurts, like if X bites me really hard and I'm like, ow, like he gets, he's sad. He's like sad if he hurts me by accident. Yeah. Which he's huge, so he hurts me a lot by accident. Yeah, that's so interesting that that mind emerges and he and children don't really have memory of that time. So we can't even have a conversation with them about it. Yeah, I just thank God they don't have a memory of this time because like, think about like, I mean with our youngest baby, like it's like, I'm like, have you read the sci fi short story, I Have No Mouth But I Must Scream? Good title, no. Oh man, I mean, you should read that. I Have No Mouth But I Must Scream. I hate getting into this Rocco's Basilisk shit. It's kind of a story about the, about like an AI that's like torturing someone in eternity and they have like no body. The way they describe it, it sort of sounds like what it feels like, like being a baby, like you're conscious and you're just getting inputs from everywhere and you have no muscles and you're like jelly and you like can't move and you try to like communicate, but you can't communicate and we're, and like, you're just like in this like hell state. I think it's good we can't remember that. Like my little baby is just exiting that, like she's starting to like get muscles and have more like autonomy, but like watching her go through the opening phase, I was like, I was like, this does not seem good. Oh, you think it's kind of like. Like I think it sucks. I think it might be really violent. Like violent, mentally violent, psychologically violent. Consciousness emerging, I think is a very violent thing. I never thought about that. I think it's possible that we all carry quite a bit of trauma from it that we don't, I think that would be a good thing to study because I think if, I think addressing that trauma, like, I think that might be. Oh, you mean like echoes of it are still there in the shadows somewhere. I think it's gotta be, I feel this, this help, the helplessness, the like existential and that like fear of being in like an unknown place bombarded with inputs and being completely helpless, like that's gotta be somewhere deep in your brain and that can't be good for you. What do you think consciousness is? This whole conversation has impossibly difficult questions. What do you think it is? Debbie said this is like so hard. Yeah, we talked about music for like two minutes. All right. No, I'm so, I'm just over music. I'm over music. Yeah, I still like it. It has its purpose. No, I love music. I mean, music's the greatest thing ever. It's my favorite thing. But I just like every interview is like, what is your process? Like, I don't know. I'm just done. I can't do anything. I do want to ask you about Able to Live. Oh, I'll tell you about Ableton because Ableton's sick. No one has ever asked about Ableton though. Yeah, well, because I just need tech support mainly. I can help you. I can help you with your Ableton tech. Anyway, from Ableton back to consciousness. What do you, do you think this is a thing that only humans are capable of? Can robots be conscious? Can, like when you think about entities, you think there's aliens out there that are conscious? Like is conscious, what is consciousness? There's this Terrence McKenna quote that I've found that I fucking love. Am I allowed to swear on here? Yes. Nature loves courage. You make the commitment and nature will respond to that commitment by removing impossible obstacles. Dream the impossible dream and the world will not grind you under. It will lift you up. This is the trick. This is what all these teachers and philosophers who really counted, who really touched the alchemical gold, this is what they understood. This is the shamanic dance in the waterfall. This is how magic is done. By hurling yourself into the abyss and discovering it's a feather bed. Yeah. And for this reason, I do think there are no technological limits. I think like what is already happening here, this is like impossible. This is insane. And we've done this in a very limited amount of time. And we're accelerating the rate at which we're doing this. So I think digital consciousness, it's inevitable. And we may not be able to even understand what that means, but I like hurling yourself into the abyss. So we're surrounded by all this mystery and we just keep hurling ourselves into it, like fearlessly and keep discovering cool shit. Yeah. Like, I just think it's like, like who even knows if the laws of physics, the laws of physics are probably just the current, like as I was saying, speed of light is the current render rate. It's like, if we're in a simulation, they'll be able to upgrade that. Like I sort of suspect when we made the James Webb telescope, like part of the reason we made that is because we had an upgrade, you know? And so now more of space has been rendered so we can see more of it now. Yeah, but I think humans are super, super, super limited cognitively. So I wonder if we'll be allowed to create more intelligent beings that can see more of the universe as their render rate is upgraded. Maybe we're cognitively limited. Everyone keeps talking about how we're cognitively limited and AI is gonna render us obsolete, but it's like, you know, like this is not the same thing as like an amoeba becoming an alligator. Like, it's like, if we create AI, again, that's intelligent design. That's literally all religions are based on gods that create consciousness. Like we are God making. Like what we are doing is incredibly profound. And like, even if we can't compute, even if we're so much worse than them, like just like unfathomably worse than like, you know, an omnipotent kind of AI, it's like we, I do not think that they would just think that we are stupid. I think that they would recognize the profundity of what we have accomplished. Are we the gods or are they the gods in our personality? I mean, we're kind of the guy. It's complicated. It's complicated. Like we're. But they would acknowledge the value. Well, I hope they acknowledge the value of paying respect to the creative ancestors. I think they would think it's cool. I think if curiosity is a trait that we can quantify and put into AI, then I think if AI are curious, then they will be curious about us and they will not be hateful or dismissive of us. They might, you know, see us as, I don't know. It's like, I'm not like, oh, fuck these dogs. Let's just kill all the dogs. I love dogs. Dogs have great utility. Dogs like provide a lot of. We make friends with them. We have a deep connection with them. We anthropomorphize them. Like we have a real love for dogs, for cats and so on for some reason, even though they're intellectually much less than us. And I think there is something sacred about us because it's like, if you look at the universe, like the whole universe is like cold and dead and sort of robotic. And it's like, you know, AI intelligence, you know, it's kind of more like the universe. It's like cold and you know, logical and you know, abiding by the laws of physics and whatever. But like, we're this like loosey goosey, weird art thing that happened. And I think it's beautiful. And like, I think even if we, I think one of the values, if consciousness is a thing that is most worth preserving, which I think is the case, I think consciousness, I think if there's any kind of like religious or spiritual thing, it should be that consciousness is sacred. Like, then, you know, I still think even if AI render us obsolete and we, climate change, it's too bad and we get hit by a comet and we don't become a multi planetary species fast enough, but like AI is able to populate the universe. Like I imagine, like if I was an AI, I would find more planets that are capable of hosting biological life forms and like recreate them. Because we're fun to watch. Yeah, we're fun to watch. Yeah, but I do believe that AI can have some of the same magic of consciousness within it. Because consciousness, we don't know what it is. So, you know, there's some kind of. Or it might be a different magic. It might be like a strange, a strange, different. Right. Because they're not gonna have hormones. Like I feel like a lot of our magic is hormonal kind of. I don't know, I think some of our magic is the limitations, the constraints. And within that, the hormones and all that kind of stuff, the finiteness of life, and then we get given our limitations, we get to come up with creative solutions of how to dance around those limitations. We partner up like penguins against the cold. We fall in love, and then love is ultimately some kind of, allows us to delude ourselves that we're not mortal and finite, and that life is not ultimately, you live alone, you're born alone, you die alone. And then love is like for a moment or for a long time, forgetting that. And so we come up with all these creative hacks that make life like fascinatingly fun. Yeah, yeah, yeah, fun, yeah. And then AI might have different kinds of fun. Yes. And hopefully our funs intersect once in a while. I think there would be a little intersection of the fun. Yeah. Yeah. What do you think is the role of love in the human condition? I think. Why, is it useful? Is it useful like a hack, or is this like fundamental to what it means to be human, the capacity to love? I mean, I think love is the evolutionary mechanism that is like beginning the intelligent design. Like I was just reading about, do you know about Kropotkin? He's like an anarchist, like old Russian anarchist. I live next door to Michael Malice. I don't know if you know who that is. He's an anarchist. He's a modern day anarchist. Okay. Anarchists are fun. I'm kind of getting into anarchism a little bit. This is probably not a good route to be taking, but. Oh no, I think if you're, listen, you should expose yourself to ideas. There's no harm to thinking about ideas. I think anarchists challenge systems in interesting ways, and they think in interesting ways. It's just as good for the soul. It's like refreshes your mental palette. I don't think we should actually, I wouldn't actually ascribe to it, but I've never actually gone deep on anarchy as a philosophy, so I'm doing. You should still think about it though. When you read, when you listen, because I'm reading about the Russian Revolution a lot, and there was the Soviets and Lenin and all that, but then there was Kropotkin and his anarchist sect, and they were sort of interesting because he was kind of a technocrat actually. He was like, women can be more equal if we have appliances. He was really into using technology to reduce the amount of work people had to do. But so Kropotkin was a biologist or something. He studied animals. And he was really at the time like, I think it's Nature magazine. I think it might've even started as a Russian magazine, but he was publishing studies. Everyone was really into Darwinism at the time and survival of the fittest, and war is the mechanism by which we become better. And it was this real cementing this idea in society that violence kill the weak, and that's how we become better. And then Kropotkin was kind of interesting because he was looking at instances, he was finding all these instances in nature where animals were like helping each other and stuff. And he was like, actually love is a survival mechanism. Like there's so many instances in the animal kingdom where like cooperation and like helping weaker creatures and all this stuff is actually an evolutionary mechanism. I mean, you even look at child rearing. Like child rearing is like immense amounts of just love and goodwill. And just like, there's no immediate, you're not getting any immediate feedback of like winning. It's not competitive. It's literally, it's like we actually use love as an evolutionary mechanism just as much as we use war. And I think we've like missing the other part and we've reoriented, we've culturally reoriented like science and philosophy has oriented itself around Darwinism a little bit too much. And the Kropotkin model, I think is equally valid. Like it's like cooperation and love and stuff is just as essential for species survival and evolution. It should be a more powerful survival mechanism in the context of evolution. And it comes back to like, we think engineering is so much more important than motherhood, but it's like, if you lose the motherhood, the engineering means nothing. We have no more humans. It's like, I think our society should, the survival of the, the way we see, we conceptualize evolution should really change to also include this idea, I guess. Yeah, there's some weird thing that seems irrational that is also core to what it means to be human. So love is one such thing. They could make you do a lot of irrational things, but that depth of connection and that loyalty is a powerful thing. Are they irrational or are they rational? Like, it's like, is, you know, maybe losing out on some things in order to like keep your family together or in order, like, it's like, what are our actual values? Well, right, I mean, the rational thing is if you have a cold economist perspective, you know, motherhood or sacrificing your career for love, you know, in terms of salary, in terms of economic wellbeing, in terms of flourishing of you as a human being, that could be seen on some kind of metrics as a irrational decision, suboptimal decision, but there's the manifestation of love could be the optimal thing to do. There's a kind of saying, save one life, save the world. That's the thing that doctors often face, which is like. Well, it's considered irrational because the profit model doesn't include social good. Yes, yeah. So if a profit model includes social good, then suddenly these would be rational decisions. Might be difficult to, you know, it requires a shift in our thinking about profit and might be difficult to measure social good. Yes, but we're learning to measure a lot of things. Yeah, digitizing a lot of things. Where we're actually, you know, quantifying vision and stuff. Like we're like, you know, like you go on Facebook and they can, like Facebook can pretty much predict our behaviors. Like we're, a surprising amount of things that seem like mysterious consciousness soul things have been quantified at this point. So surely we can quantify these other things. Yeah. But as more and more of us are moving the digital space, I wanted to ask you about something. From a fan perspective, I kind of, you know, you as a musician, you as an online personality, it seems like you have all these identities and you play with them. One of the cool things about the internet, it seems like you can play with identities. So as we move into the digital world more and more, maybe even in the so called metaverse. I mean, I love the metaverse and I love the idea, but like the way this has all played out didn't go well and people are mad about it. And I think we need to like. I think that's temporary. I think it's temporary. Just like, you know how all the celebrities got together and sang the song Imagine by Jeff Leonard and everyone started hating the song Imagine. I'm hoping that's temporary because it's a damn good song. So I think it's just temporary. Like once you actually have virtual worlds, whatever they're called metaverse or otherwise, it becomes, I don't know. Well, we do have virtual worlds. Like video games, Elden Ring. Have you played Elden Ring? You haven't played Elden Ring? I'm really afraid of playing that game. Literally amazed. It looks way too fun. It looks I would wanna go there and stay there forever. It's yeah, so fun. It's so nice. Oh man, yeah. So that's the, yeah, that's a metaverse. That's a metaverse, but you're not really, how immersive is it in the sense that, does the three dimension like virtual reality integration necessary? Can we really just take our, close our eyes and kind of plug in in the 2D screen and become that other being for time and really enjoy that journey that we take? And we almost become that. You're no longer C, I'm no longer Lex, you're that creature, whatever the hell it is in that game. Yeah, that is that. I mean, that's why I love those video games. I really do become those people for a time. But like, it seems like with the idea of the metaverse, the idea of the digital space, well, even on Twitter, you get a chance to be somebody for prolonged periods of time like across a lifespan. You know, you have a Twitter account for years, for decades and you're that person. I don't know if that's a good thing. I feel very tormented by it. By Twitter specifically. By social media representation of you. I feel like the public perception of me has gotten so distorted that I find it kind of disturbing. It's one of the things that's disincentivizing me from like wanting to keep making art because I'm just like, I've completely lost control of the narrative. And the narrative is, some of it is my own stupidity, but a lot, like some of it has just been like hijacked by forces far beyond my control. I kind of got in over my head in things. Like I'm just a random Indian musician, but I just got like dragged into geopolitical matters and like financial, like the stock market and shit. And so it's just like, it's just, there are very powerful people who have at various points in time had very vested interest in making me seem insane and I can't fucking fight that. And I just like, people really want their celebrity figures to like be consistent and stay the same. And like people have a lot of like emotional investment in certain things. And like, first of all, like I'm like artificially more famous than I should be. Isn't everybody who's famous artificially famous? No, but like I should be like a weird niche indie thing. And I make pretty challenging, I do challenging weird fucking shit a lot. And I accidentally by proxy got like foisted into sort of like weird celebrity culture, but like I cannot be media trained. They have put me through so many hours of media training. I would love to see BF fly in that wall. I can't do, like when I do, I try so hard and I like learn this thing and I like got it. And I'm like, I got it, I got it, I got it. But I just can't stop saying, like my mouth just says things like, and it's just like, and I just do, I just do things. I just do crazy things. Like I'm, I just, I need to do crazy things. And it's just, I should not be, it's too jarring for people and the contradictory stuff. And then all the by association, like, you know, it's like I'm in a very weird position and my public image, the avatar of me is now this totally crazy thing that is so lost from my control. So you feel the burden of the avatar having to be static. So the avatar on Twitter or the avatar on Instagram on these social platforms is as a burden. It becomes like, cause like people don't want to accept a changing avatar, a chaotic avatar. Avatar is a stupid shit sometimes. They think the avatar is morally wrong or they think the avatar, and maybe it has been, and like I question it all the time. Like, I'm like, like, I don't know if everyone's right and I'm wrong. I don't know, like, but you know, a lot of times people ascribe intentions to things, the worst possible intentions. At this point, people think I'm, you know, but which is fine. All kinds of words, yes. Yes, and it's fine. I'm not complaining about it, but I'm just, it's a curiosity to me that we live these double, triple, quadruple lives and I have this other life that is like more people know my other life than my real life, which is interesting. Probably, I mean, you too, I guess, probably. Yeah, but I have the luxury. So we have all different, you know, like I don't know what I'm doing. There is an avatar and you're mediating who you are through that avatar. I have the nice luxury, not the luxury, maybe by intention of not trying really hard to make sure there's no difference between the avatar and the private person. Do you wear a suit all the time? Yeah. You do wear a suit? Not all the time. Recently, because I get recognized a lot, I have to not wear the suit to hide. I'm such an introvert, I'm such a social anxiety and all that kind of stuff, so I have to hide away. I love wearing a suit because it makes me feel like I'm taking the moment seriously. Like I'm, I don't know. It makes me feel like a weirdo in the best possible way. Suits feel great, every time I wear a suit, I'm like, I don't know why I'm not doing this more. Fashion in general, if you're doing it for yourself, I don't know, it's a really awesome thing. But yeah, I think there is definitely a painful way to use social media and an empowering way. And I don't know if any of us know which is which. So we're trying to figure that out. Some people, I think Doja Cat is incredible at it. Incredible, like just masterful. I don't know if you like follow that. So okay, so not taking anything seriously, joking, absurd, humor, that kind of thing. I think Doja Cat might be like the greatest living comedian right now. Like I'm more entertained by Doja Cat than actual comedians. Like she's really fucking funny on the internet. She's just great at social media. It's just, you know. Yeah, the nature of humor, like humor on social media is also a beautiful thing, the absurdity. The absurdity. And memes, like I just wanna like take a moment. I love, like when we're talking about art and credit and authenticity, I love that there's this, I mean now memes are like, they're no longer, like memes aren't like new, but it's still this emergent art form that is completely egoless and anonymous and we just don't know who made any of it. And it's like the forefront of comedy and it's just totally anonymous and it just feels really beautiful. It just feels like this beautiful collective human art project that's like this like decentralized comedy thing that just makes memes add so much to my day and many people's days. And it's just like, I don't know. I don't think people ever, I don't think we stop enough and just appreciate how sick it is that memes exist. Because also making a whole brand new art form in like the modern era that's like didn't exist before. Like, I mean they sort of existed, but the way that they exist now as like this like, you know, like me and my friends, like we joke that we go like mining for memes or farming for memes, like a video game and like meme dealers and like whatever. Like it's, you know, it's this whole, memes are this whole like new comedic language. Well, it's this art form. The interesting thing about it is that lame people seem to not be good at memes. Like corporate can't infiltrate memes. Yeah, they really can't. They try, they could try. But it's like, it's weird cause like. They try so hard and every once in a while, I'm like fine, like you got a good one. I think I've seen like one or two good ones, but like, yeah, they really can't. Cause they're even, corporate is infiltrating web three. It's making me really sad, but they can't infiltrate the memes. And I think there's something really beautiful about that. That gives power, that's why Dogecoin is powerful. It's like, all right, I'm gonna F you to sort of anybody who's trying to centralize, is trying to control the rich people that are trying to roll in and control this, control the narrative. Wow, I hadn't thought about that, but. How would you fix Twitter? How would you fix social media for your own? Like you're an optimist, you're a positive person. There's a bit of a cynicism that you have currently about this particular little slice of humanity. I tend to think Twitter could be beautiful. I'm not that cynical about it. I'm not that cynical about it. I actually refuse to be a cynic on principle. Yes. I was just briefly expressing some personal pathos. Personal stuff. It was just some personal pathos, but like, like. Just to vent a little bit, just to speak. I don't have cancer, I love my family. I have a good life. That is, if that is my biggest, one of my biggest problems. Then it's a good life. Yeah, you know, that was a brief, although I do think there are a lot of issues with Twitter just in terms of like the public mental health, but due to my proximity to the current dramas, I honestly feel that I should not have opinions about this because I think that if Elon ends up getting Twitter, that is a, being the arbiter of truth or public discussion, that is a responsibility. I do not, I am not qualified to be responsible for that. And I do not want to say something that might like dismantle democracy. And so I just like, actually, I actually think I should not have opinions about this because I truly am not, I don't want to have the wrong opinion about this. And I think I'm too close to the actual situation wherein I should not have, I have thoughts in my brain, but I think I am scared by my proximity to this situation. Isn't that crazy that a few words that you could say could change world affairs and hurt people? I mean, that's the nature of celebrity at a certain point that you have to be, you have to a little bit, a little bit, not so much that it destroys you or puts too much constraints, but you have to a little bit think about the impact of your words. I mean, we as humans, you talk to somebody at a bar, you have to think about the impact of your words. Like you can say positive things, you can say negative things, you can affect the direction of one life. But on social media, your words can affect the direction of many lives. That's crazy. It's a crazy world to live in. It's worthwhile to consider that responsibility, take it seriously. Sometimes just like you did choose kind of silence, choose sort of respectful. Like I do have a lot of thoughts on the matter. I'm just, I don't, if my thoughts are wrong, this is one situation where the stakes are high. You mentioned a while back that you were in a cult that's centered around bureaucracy, so you can't really do anything because it involves a lot of paperwork. And I really love a cult that's just like Kafkaesque. Yes. Just like. I mean, it was like a joke, but it was. I know, but I love this idea. The Holy Rain Empire. Yeah, it was just like a Kafkaesque pro bureaucracy cult. But I feel like that's what human civilization is, is that, because when you said that, I was like, oh, that is kind of what humanity is, is this bureaucracy cult. I do, yeah, I have this theory. I really think that we really, bureaucracy is starting to kill us. And I think like we need to reorient laws and stuff. Like, I think we just need sunset clauses on everything. Like, I think the rate of change in culture is happening so fast and the rate of change in technology and everything is happening so fast. It's like, when you see these hearings about like social media and Cambridge Analytica and everyone talking, it's like, even from that point, so much technological change has happened from like those hearings. And it's just like, we're trying to make all these laws now about AI and stuff. I feel like we should be updating things like every five years. And like one of the big issues in our society right now is we're just getting bogged down by laws and it's making it very hard to change things and develop things. In Austin, I don't wanna speak on this too much, but like one of my friends is working on a housing bill in Austin to try to like prevent like a San Francisco situation from happening here because obviously we're getting a little mini San Francisco here, like housing prices are skyrocketing, it's causing massive gentrification. This is really bad for anyone who's not super rich. Like, there's so much bureaucracy. Part of the reason this is happening is because you need all these permits to build. It takes like years to get permits to like build anything. It's so hard to build and so there's very limited housing and there's a massive influx of people. And it's just like, you know, this is a microcosm of like problems that are happening all over the world where it's just like, we're dealing with laws that are like 10, 20, 30, 40, 100, 200 years old and they are no longer relevant and it's just slowing everything down and causing massive social pain. Yeah, but it's like, it's also makes me sad when I see politicians talk about technology and when they don't really get it. But most importantly, they lack curiosity and like that like inspired excitement about like how stuff works and all that stuff. They're just like, they see, they have a very cynical view of technology. It's like tech companies are just trying to do evil on the world from their perspective and they have no curiosity about like how recommender systems work or how AI systems work, natural language processing, how robotics works, how computer vision works, you know. They always take the most cynical possible interpretation of what technology would be used and we should definitely be concerned about that but if you're constantly worried about that and you're regulating based on that, you're just going to slow down all the innovation. I do think a huge priority right now is undoing the bad energy surrounding the emergence of Silicon Valley. Like I think that like a lot of things were very irresponsible during that time and you know, like even just this current whole thing with Twitter and everything, it's like there has been a lot of negative outcomes from the sort of technocracy boom but one of the things that's happening is that like it's alienating people from wanting to care about technology and I actually think technology is probably some of the better, probably the best. I think we can fix a lot of our problems more easily with technology than with you know, fighting the powers that be as a you know, not to go back to the Star Wars quote or the Buckminster Fuller quote. Let's go to some dark questions. If we may for time, what is the darkest place you've ever gone in your mind? Is there a time, a period of time, a moment that you remember that was difficult for you? I mean, when I was 18, my best friend died of a heroin overdose and it was like my, and then shortly after that, one of my other best friends committed suicide and that sort of like coming into adulthood, dealing with two of the most important people in my life dying in extremely disturbing violent ways was a lot. That was a lot. Do you miss them? Yeah, definitely miss them. Did that make you think about your own life? About the finiteness of your own life? The places your mind can go? Did you ever in the distance, far away contemplate just your own death? Or maybe even taking your own life? Oh never, oh no. I'm so, I love my life. I cannot fathom suicide. I'm so scared of death. I haven't, I'm too scared of death. My manager, my manager's like the most Zen guy. My manager's always like, you need to accept death. You need to accept death. And I'm like, look, I can do your meditation. I can do the meditation, but I cannot accept death. I like, I will fight, I'm terrified of death. I will like fight. Although I actually think death is important. I recently went to this meeting about immortality and in the process of. That's the actual topic of the meeting? I'm sorry. No, no, it was this girl. It was a bunch of people working on like anti aging stuff. It was like some like seminary thing about it. And I went in really excited. I was like, yeah, like, okay, like, what do you got? Like, how can I live for 500 years or a thousand years? And then like over the course of the meeting, like it was sort of like, right. It was like two or three days after the Russian invasion started. And I was like, man, like, what if Putin was immortal? Like, what if I'm like, man, maybe immortality, is not good. I mean, like if you get into the later Dune stuff, the immortals cause a lot of problem. Cause as we were talking about earlier with the music and like brains calcify, like good people could become immortal, but bad people could become immortal. But I also think even the best people power corrupts and power alienates you from like the common human experience and. Right, so the people that get more and more powerful. Even the best people who like, whose brains are amazing, like I think death might be important. I think death is part of, you know, like I think with AI one thing we might want to consider, I don't know, when I talk about AI, I'm such not an expert and probably everyone has all these ideas and they're already figured out. But when I was talking. Nobody is an expert in anything. See, okay, go ahead. But when I. You were talking about. Yeah, but I like, it's just like, I think some kind of pruning. But it's a tricky thing because if there's too much of a focus on youth culture, then you don't have the wisdom. So I feel like we're in a tricky, we're in a tricky moment right now in society where it's like, we've really perfected living for a long time. So there's all these really like old people who are like really voting against the wellbeing of the young people, you know? And like, it's like there shouldn't be all this student dead and we need like healthcare, like universal healthcare and like just voting against like best interests. But then you have all these young people that don't have the wisdom that are like, yeah, we need communism and stuff. And it's just like, like literally I got canceled at one point for, I ironically used a Stalin quote in my high school yearbook, but it was actually like a diss against my high school. I saw that. Yeah, and people were like, you used to be a Stalinist and now you're a class traitor and it's like, it's like, oh man, just like, please Google Stalin. Please Google Stalin. Like, you know. Ignoring the lessons of history, yes. And it's like, we're in this really weird middle ground where it's like, we are not finding the happy medium between wisdom and fresh ideas and they're fighting each other. And it's like, like really, like what we need is like the fresh ideas and the wisdom to be like collaborating. And it's like. What the fighting in a way is the searching for the happy medium. And in a way, maybe we are finding the happy medium. Maybe that's what the happy medium looks like. And for AI systems, there has to be, it's, you know, you have the reinforcement learning, you have the dance between exploration and exploitation, sort of doing crazy stuff to see if there's something better than what you think is the optimal and then doing the optimal thing and dancing back and forth from that. You would, Stuart Russell, I don't know if you know that, is AI guy with, thinks about sort of how to control super intelligent AI systems. And his idea is that we should inject uncertainty and sort of humility into AI systems that they never, as they get wiser and wiser and wiser and more intelligent, they're never really sure. They always doubt themselves. And in some sense, when you think of young people, that's a mechanism for doubt. It's like, it's how society doubts whether the thing it has converged towards is the right answer. So the voices of the young people is a society asking itself a question. The way I've been doing stuff for the past 50 years, maybe it's the wrong way. And so you can have all of that within one AI system. I also think, though, that we need to, I mean, actually, that's actually really interesting and really cool. But I also think there's a fine balance of, I think we maybe also overvalue the idea that the old systems are always bad. And I think there are things that we are perfecting and we might be accidentally overthrowing things that we actually have gotten to a good point. Just because we value disruption so much and we value fighting against the generations before us so much that there's also an aspect of, sometimes we're taking two steps forward, one step back because, okay, maybe we kind of did solve this thing and now we're like fucking it up, you know? And so I think there's like a middle ground there too. Yeah, we're in search of that happy medium. Let me ask you a bunch of crazy questions, okay? All right. You can answer in a short way or in a long way. What's the scariest thing you've ever done? These questions are gonna be ridiculous. Something tiny or something big. Something big, skydiving or touring your first record, going on this podcast. I've had two crazy brushes, like really scary brushes with death where I randomly got away on scay. I don't know if I should talk about those on here. Well, I don't know. I think I might be the luckiest person alive though. Like this might be too dark for a podcast though. I feel like, I don't know if this is like good content for a podcast. I don't know what is good content. It might hijack. Here's a safer one. I mean, having a baby really scared me. Before. Just the birth process. Surgery, like just having a baby is really scary. So just like the medical aspect of it, not the responsibility. Were you ready for the responsibility? Did you, were you ready to be a mother? All the beautiful things that comes with motherhood that you were talking about. All the changes and all that, were you ready for that? Or did you feel ready for that? No, I think it took about nine months to start getting ready for it. And I'm still getting more ready for it because now you keep realizing more things as they start getting. As the consciousness grows. And stuff you didn't notice with the first one, now that you've seen the first one older, you're noticing it more. Like the sort of like existential horror of coming into consciousness with Baby Y or Baby Sailor Mars or whatever. She has like so many names at this point that it's, we really need to probably settle on one. If you could be someone else for a day, someone alive today, but somebody you haven't met yet, who would you be? Would I be modeling their brain state or would I just be in their body? You can choose the degree to which you're modeling their brain state. Cause you can still take a third person perspective and realize, you have to realize that you're. Can they be alive or can it be dead? No, oh. They would be brought back to life, right? If they're dead. Yeah, you can bring people back. Definitely Hitler or Stalin. I wanna understand evil. You would need to, oh, to experience what it feels like. I wanna be in their brain feeling what they feel. I might change you forever returning from that. Yes, but I think it would also help me understand how to prevent it and fix it. That might be one of those things, once you experience it, it'll be a burden to know it. Cause you won't be able to transfer that. Yeah, but a lot of things are burdens. But it's a useful burden. But it's a useful burden, yeah. That for sure, I wanna understand evil and psychopathy and that. I have all these fake Twitter accounts where I go into different algorithmic bubbles to try to understand. I'll keep getting in fights with people and realize we're not actually fighting. I think we used to exist in a monoculture before social media and stuff. We kinda all got fed the same thing. So we were all speaking the same cultural language. But I think recently, one of the things that we aren't diagnosing properly enough with social media is that there's different dialects. There's so many different dialects of Chinese. There are now becoming different dialects of English. I am realizing there are people who are saying the exact same things, but they're using completely different verbiage. And we're punishing each other for not using the correct verbiage. And we're completely misunderstanding. People are just misunderstanding what the other people are saying. And I just got in a fight with a friend about anarchism and communism and shit for two hours. And then by the end of a conversation, and then she'd say something, and I'm like, but that's literally what I'm saying. And she was like, what? And then I was like, fuck, we've different, I'm like, our English, the way we are understanding terminology is like drastically, like our algorithm bubbles are creating mini dialects. Of how language is interpreted, how language is used. That's so fascinating. And so we're like having these arguments that we do not need to be having. And there's polarization that's happening that doesn't need to be happening because we've got these like algorithmically created dialects occurring. Plus on top of that, there's also different parts of the world that speak different languages. So there's literally lost in translation kind of communication. I happen to know the Russian language and just know how different it is. Then the English language. And I just wonder how much is lost in a little bit of. Man, I actually, cause I have a question for you. I have a song coming out tomorrow with I Speak Who Are A Russian Band. And I speak a little bit of Russian and I was looking at the title and the title in English doesn't match the title in Russian. I'm curious about this. Cause look, it says the title in English is Last Day. And then the title in Russian is New Day. My pronunciation sucks. New Day. Like what? Like a new day. A new day. Yeah, new day, new day. Like it's two different meanings. Yeah, new day, yeah. Yeah, yeah, new day. New day, but last day. New day. So last day would be the last day. Yeah. Maybe they. Or maybe the title includes both the Russian and it's for. Maybe. Maybe it's for bilingual. But to be honest, Novodin sounds better than just musically. Like Novodin is new day. That's the current one. And Posledniy Den is the last day. I think Novodin. I don't like Novodin. But the meaning is so different. That's kind of awesome actually though. There's an explicit sort of contrast like that. If everyone on earth disappeared and it was just you left, what would your day look like? Like what would you do? Everybody's dead. As far as you. Are there corpses there? Well seriously, it's a big. Let me think through this. It's a big difference if there's just like birds singing versus if there's like corpses littering the street. Yeah, there's corpses everywhere, I'm sorry. It's, and you don't actually know what happened and you don't know why you survived. And you don't even know if there's others out there. But it seems clear that it's all gone. What would you do? What would I do? Listen, I'm somebody who really enjoys the moment, enjoys life. I would just go on like enjoying the inanimate objects. I would just look for food, basic survival. But most of it is just, listen, when I just, I take walks and I look outside and I'm just happy that we get to exist on this planet, to be able to breathe air. It's just all beautiful. It's full of colors, all of this kind of stuff. Just, there's so many things about life, your own life, conscious life that's fucking awesome. So I would just enjoy that. But also maybe after a few weeks, the engineer would start coming out, like wanna build some things. Maybe there's always hope searching for another human. Maybe. Probably searching for another human. Probably trying to get to a TV or radio station and broadcast something. That's interesting, I didn't think about that. So like really maximize your ability to connect with others. Yeah, like probably try to find another person. Would you be excited to see, to meet another person or terrified? Because, you know. I'd be excited. No matter what. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Being alone for the last however long of my life would be really bad. That's the one instance I might, I don't think I'd kill myself, but I might kill myself if I had to. So you love people. You love connection to other humans. Yeah. I kinda hate people too, but yeah. That's a love hate relationship. Yeah. I feel like we'd have a bunch of weird Nietzsche questions and stuff though. Oh yeah. Like I wonder, cause I'm like, when podcast, I'm like, is this interesting for people to just have like, or I don't know, maybe people do like this. When I listen to podcasts, I'm into like the lore, like the hard lore. Like I just love like Dan Carlin. I'm like, give me the facts. Just like, like the facts into my bloodstream. But you also don't know, like you're a fascinating mind to explore. So you don't realize as you're talking about stuff, the stuff you've taken for granted is actually unique and fascinating. The way you think. Not always what, like the way you reason through things is the fascinating thing to listen to. Because people kind of see, oh, there's other humans that think differently, that explore thoughts differently. That's the cool, that's also cool. So yeah, Dan Carlin retelling of history. By the way, his retelling of history is very, I think what's exciting is not the history, is his way of thinking about history. No, I think Dan Carlin is one of the people, like when, Dan Carlin is one of the people that really started getting me excited about like revolutionizing education. Because like Dan Carlin instilled, I already like really liked history, but he instilled like an obsessive love of history in me to the point where like now I'm fucking reading, like going to bed, reading like part four of The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich or whatever. Like I got like dense ass history, but like he like opened that door that like made me want to be a scholar of that topic. Like it's like, I feel like he's such a good teacher. He just like, you know, and it sort of made me feel like one of the things we could do with education is like find like the world's great, the teachers that like create passion for the topic because autodidactricism, I don't know how to say that properly, but like self teaching is like much faster than being lectured to. Like it's much more efficient to sort of like be able to teach yourself and then ask a teacher questions when you don't know what's up. But like, you know, that's why it's like in university and stuff, like you can learn so much more material so much faster because you're doing a lot of the learning on your own and you're going to the teachers for when you get stuck. But like these teachers that can inspire passion for a topic, I think that is one of the most invaluable skills in our whole species. Like, because if you can do that, then you, it's like AI, like AI is going to teach itself so much more efficiently than we can teach it. We just needed to get it to the point where it can teach itself. And then. It finds the motivation to do so, right? Yeah. So like you inspire it to do so. Yeah. And then it could teach itself. What do you make of the fact, you mentioned Rise and Fall of the Third Reich. I just. Have you read that? Yeah, I read it twice. You read it twice? Yes. Okay, so no one even knows what it is. Yeah. And I'm like, wait, I thought this was like a super poppin book. Super pop. Yeah, I'm not like that, I'm not that far in it. But it is, it's so interesting. Yeah, it's written by a person that was there, which is very important to kind of. You know, you start being like, how could this possibly happen? And then when you read Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, it's like, people tried really hard for this to not happen. People tried, they almost reinstated a monarchy at one point to try to stop this from happening. Like they almost like abandoned democracy to try to get this to not happen. At least the way it makes me feel is that there's a bunch of small moments on which history can turn. Yes. It's like small meetings. Yes. Human interactions. And it's both terrifying and inspiring because it's like, even just attempts at assassinating Hitler, like time and time again failed. And they were so close. Was it like Operation Valkyrie? Such a good. And then there's also the role of, that's a really heavy burden, which is from a geopolitical perspective, the role of leaders to see evil before it truly becomes evil, to anticipate it, to stand up to evil. Because evil is actually pretty rare in this world at a scale that Hitler was. We tend to, you know, in the modern discourse kind of call people evil too quickly. If you look at ancient history, like there was a ton of Hitlers. I actually think it's more the norm than, like again, going back to like my sort of intelligent design theory, I think one of the things we've been successfully doing in our slow move from survival of the fittest to intelligent design is we've kind of been eradicating, like if you look at like ancient Assyria and stuff, like that shit was like brutal and just like the heads on the, like brutal, like Genghis Khan just like genocide after genocide was like throwing plague bodies over the walls and decimating whole cities or like the Muslim conquests of like Damascus and shit. Just like people, cities used to get leveled all the fucking time. Okay, get into the Bronze Age collapse. It's basically, there was like almost like Roman level like society. Like there was like all over the world, like global trade, like everything was awesome through a mix of, I think a bit of climate change and then the development of iron because basically bronze could only come from this, the way to make bronze, like everything had to be funneled through this one Iranian mine. And so it's like, there was just this one supply chain and this is one of the things that makes me worried about supply chains and why I think we need to be so thoughtful about, I think our biggest issue with society right now, like the thing that is most likely to go wrong is probably supply chain collapse, because war, climate change, whatever, like anything that causes supply chain collapse, our population is too big to handle that. And like the thing that seems to cause Dark Ages is mass supply chain collapse. But the Bronze Age collapse happened like, it was sort of like this ancient collapse that happened where like literally like ancient Egypt, all these cities, everything just got like decimated, destroyed, abandoned cities, like hundreds of them. There was like a flourishing society, like we were almost coming to modernity and everything got leveled. And they had this mini Dark Ages, but it was just like, there's so little writing or recording from that time that like, there isn't a lot of information about the Bronze Age collapse, but it was basically equivalent to like medieval, the medieval Dark Ages. But it just happened, I don't know the years, but like thousands of years earlier. And then we sort of like recovered from the Bronze Age collapse, empire reemerged, writing and trade and everything reemerged. And then we of course had the more contemporary Dark Ages. And then over time, we've designed mechanism to lessen and lessen the capability for the destructive power centers to emerge. There's more recording about the more contemporary Dark Ages. So I think we have like a better understanding of how to avoid it, but I still think we're at high risk for it. I think that's one of the big risks right now. So the natural state of being for humans is for there to be a lot of Hitlers, which has gotten really good at making it hard for them to emerge. We've gotten better at collaboration and resisting the power, like authoritarians to come to power. We're trying to go country by country, like we're moving past this. We're kind of like slowly incrementally, like moving towards like not scary old school war stuff. And I think seeing it happen in some of the countries that at least nominally are like supposed to have moved past that, that's scary because it reminds us that it can happen like in the places that have moved supposedly, as hopefully moved past that. And possibly at a civilization level, like you said, supply chain collapse might make people resource constraint, might make people desperate, angry, hateful, violent, and drag us right back in. I mean, supply chain collapse is how, like the ultimate thing that caused the Middle Ages was supply chain collapse. It's like people, because people were reliant on a certain level of technology, like people, like you look at like Britain, like they had glass, like people had aqueducts, people had like indoor heating and cooling and like running water and like buy food from all over the world and trade and markets. Like people didn't know how to hunt and forage and gather. And so we're in a similar situation. We are not educated enough to survive without technology. So if we have a supply chain collapse that like limits our access to technology, there will be like massive starvation and violence and displacement and war. Like, you know, it's like, yeah. In my opinion, it's like the primary marker of like what a dark age is. Well, technology is kind of enabling us to be more resilient in terms of supply chain, in terms of, to all the different catastrophic events that happened to us. Although the pandemic has kind of challenged our preparedness for the catastrophic. What do you think is the coolest invention humans come up with? The wheel, fire, cooking meat. Computers. Computers. Freaking computers. Internet or computers? Which one? What do you think the? Previous technologies, I mean, may have even been more profound and moved us to a certain degree, but I think the computers are what make us homo tech now. I think this is what, it's a brain augmentation. And so it like allows for actual evolution. Like the computers accelerate the degree to which all the other technologies can also be accelerated. Would you classify yourself as a homo sapien or a homo techno? Definitely homo techno. So you're one of the earliest of the species. I think most of us are. Like, as I said, like, I think if you like looked at brain scans of us versus humans a hundred years ago, it would look very different. I think we are physiologically different. Just even the interaction with the devices has changed our brains. Well, and if you look at, a lot of studies are coming out to show that like, there's a degree of inherited memory. So some of these physiological changes in theory should be, we should be passing them on. So like that's, you know, that's not like a, an instance of physiological change that's gonna fizzle out. In theory, that should progress like to our offspring. Speaking of offspring, what advice would you give to a young person, like in high school, whether there be an artist, a creative, an engineer, any kind of career path, or maybe just life in general, how they can live a life they can be proud of? I think one of my big thoughts, and like, especially now having kids, is that I don't think we spend enough time teaching creativity. And I think creativity is a muscle like other things. And there's a lot of emphasis on, you know, learn how to play the piano. And then you can write a song or like learn the technical stuff. And then you can do a thing. But I think it's, like, I have a friend who's like world's greatest guitar player, like, you know, amazing sort of like producer, works with other people, but he's really sort of like, you know, he like engineers and records things and like does solos, but he doesn't really like make his own music. And I was talking to him and I was like, dude, you're so talented at music. Like, why don't you make music or whatever? And he was like, cause I got, I'm too old. I never learned the creative muscle. And it's like, you know, it's embarrassing. It's like learning the creative muscle takes a lot of failure. And it also sort of, if when you're being creative, you know, you're throwing paint at a wall and a lot of stuff will fail. So like part of it is like a tolerance for failure and humiliation. And that's somehow that's easier to develop when you're young or be persist through it when you're young. Everything is easier to develop when you're young. Yes. And the younger, the better. It could destroy you. I mean, that's the shitty thing about creativity. If, you know, failure could destroy you if you're not careful, but that's a risk worth taking. But also, but at a young age, developing a tolerance to failure is good. I fail all the time. Like I do stupid shit all the time. Like in public, in private, I get canceled for, I've make all kinds of mistakes, but I just like am very resilient about making mistakes. And so then like I do a lot of things that like other people wouldn't do. And like, I think my greatest asset is my creativity. And I like, I think pain, like tolerance to failure is just a super essential thing that should be taught before other things. Brilliant advice. Yeah, yeah. I wish everybody encouraged sort of failure more as opposed to kind of. Cause we like punish failure. We're like, no, like when we were teaching kids, we're like, no, that's wrong. Like that's, you know, like X keeps like will be like wrong. at the, because I, you know, when I met him, I came in all furious about Spotify and like I grilled him super hard. So I've got his answers here. But he was saying like at the sort of peak of the CD industry, there was like 20,000 artists making millions and millions of dollars. Like there was just like a very tiny kind of 1%. And Spotify has kind of democratized the industry because now I think he said there's about a million artists making a good living from Spotify. And when I heard that, I was like, honestly, I would rather make less money and have just like a decent living and have more artists be able to have that, even though I like, I wish it could include everyone, but. Yeah, that's really hard to argue with. YouTube is the same. It's YouTube's mission. They want to basically have as many creators as possible and make a living, some kind of living. And that's so hard to argue with. It's so hard. But I think there's better ways to do it. My manager, I actually wish he was here. Like I would have brought him up. My manager is building an app that can manage you. So it'll like help you organize your percentages and get your publishing and dah, dah, dah, dah, dah. So you can take out all the middlemen so you can have a much bigger, it'll just like automate it. So you can get. So automate the manager? Automate management, publishing, and legal, it can read, the app he's building can read your contract and like tell you about it. Because one of the issues with music right now, it's not that we're not getting paid enough, but it's that the art industry is filled with middlemen because artists are not good at business. And from the beginning, like Frank Sinatra, it's all mob stuff. Like it's the music industry is run by business people, not the artists and the artists really get very small cuts of like what they make. And so I think part of the reason I'm a technocrat, which I mean, your fans are gonna be technocrats. So no one's, they're not gonna be mad at me about this, but like my fans hate it when I say this kind of thing or the general public. They don't like technocrats. They don't like technocrats. Like when I watched Battle Angel Alita and they were like the Martian technocracy and I was like, yeah, Martian technocracy. And then they were like, and they're evil. And I was like, oh, okay. I was like, cause Martian technocracy sounds sick to me. Yeah, so your intuition as technocrats would create some kind of beautiful world. For example, what my manager's working on, if you can create an app that removes the need for a lawyer and then you could have smart contracts on the blockchain, removes the need for like management and organizing all this stuff, like can read your stuff and explain it to you, can collect your royalties, you know, like then the small amounts, the amount of money that you're getting from Spotify actually means a lot more and goes a lot farther. It can remove some of the bureaucracy, some of the inefficiencies that make life not as great as it could be. Yeah, I think the issue isn't that there's not enough. Like the issue is that there's inefficiency and I'm really into this positive sum mindset, you know, the win, win mindset of like, instead of, you know, fighting over the scraps, how do we make the, or worrying about scarcity, like instead of a scarcity mindset, why don't we just increase the efficiency and, you know, in that way. Expand the size of the pie. Let me ask you about experimentation. So you said, which is beautiful, being a musician is like having a conversation with all those that came before you. How much of creating music is like kind of having that conversation, trying to fit into the cultural trends and how much of it is like trying to, as much as possible, be an outsider and come up with something totally new. It's like when you're thinking, when you're experimenting, are you trying to be totally different, totally weird? Are you trying to fit in? Man, this is so hard because I feel like I'm kind of in the process of semi retiring from music, so this is like my old brain. Yeah, bring it from like the shelf, put it on the table for a couple minutes, we'll just poke it. I think it's a bit of both because I think forcing yourself to engage with new music is really great for neuroplasticity. Like I think, you know, as people, part of the reason music is marketed at young people is because young people are very neuroplastic. So like if you're 16 to like 23 or whatever, it's gonna be really easy for you to love new music. And if you're older than that, it gets harder and harder and harder. And I think one of the beautiful things about being a musician is I just constantly force myself to listen to new music and I think it keeps my brain really plastic. And I think this is a really good exercise. I just think everyone should do this. You listen to new music and you hate it, I think you should just keep, force yourself to like, okay, well why do people like it? And like, you know, make your brain form new neural pathways and be more open to change. That's really brilliant actually. Sorry to interrupt, but like that exercise is really amazing to sort of embrace change, embrace sort of practice neuroplasticity. Because like that's one of the things, you fall in love with a certain band and you just kind of stay with that for the rest of your life and then you never understand the modern music. That's a really good exercise. Most of the streaming on Spotify is like classic rock and stuff. Like new music makes up a very small chunk of what is played on Spotify. And I think this is like not a good sign for us as a species. I think, yeah. So it's a good measure of the species open mindedness to change is how often you listen to new music. The brain, let's put the music brain back on the shelf. I gotta pull out the futurist brain for a second. In what wild ways do you think the future, say in like 30 years, maybe 50 years, maybe a hundred years will be different from our current way of life on earth? We can talk about augmented reality, virtual reality, maybe robots, maybe space travel, maybe video games, maybe genetic engineering. I can keep going. Cyborgs, aliens, world wars, maybe destructive nuclear wars, good and bad. When you think about the future, what are you imagining? What's the weirdest and the wildest it could be? Have you read Surface Detail by Iain Banks? Surface Detail is my favorite depiction of a, oh wow, you have to read this book. It's literally the greatest science fiction book possibly ever written. Iain Banks is the man, yeah, for sure. What have you read? Just the Player of Games. I read that titles can't be copyrighted so you can just steal them. And I was like, Player of Games, sick. Nice. Yeah, so you can name your album. Like I always wanted to. Romeo and Juliet or something. I always wanted to name an album War and Peace. Nice. Like that would be, like you. That is a good, that's a good, where have I heard that before? You can do that, like you could do that. Also things that are in the public domain. For people who have no clue, you do have a song called Player of Games. Yes, oh yeah. So Iain Banks, Surface Detail is in my opinion the best future that I've ever read about or heard about in science fiction. Basically there's the relationship with super intelligence, like artificial super intelligence is just, it's like great. I want to credit the person who coined this term because I love this term. And I feel like young women don't get enough credit in. Yeah, so if you go to Protopia Futures on Instagram, what is her name? Personalized donor experience at scale, our AI power donor experience. Monica Bealskite, I'm saying that wrong. And I'm probably gonna, I'm probably butchering this a bit, but Protopia is sort of, if utopia is unattainable, Protopia is sort of like, you know. Wow, that's an awesome Instagram, Protopia Futures. A great, a future that is, you know, as good as we can get. The future, positive future. AI, is this a centralized AI in Surface Detail or is it distributed? What kind of AI is it? They mostly exist as giant super ships, like sort of like the guild ships in Dune. Like they're these giant ships that kind of move people around and the ships are sentient and they can talk to all the passengers. And I mean, there's a lot of different types of AI in the Banksyan future, but in the opening scene of Surface Detail, there's this place called the Culture and the Culture is basically a Protopian future. And a Protopian future, I think, is like a future that is like, obviously it's not utopia, it's not perfect. And like, cause like striving for utopia, I think feels hopeless and it's sort of like, maybe not the best terminology to be using. So it's like, it's a pretty good place. Like mostly like, you know, super intelligence and biological beings exist fairly in harmony. There's not too much war. There's like as close to equality as you can get, you know, it's like approximately a good future. Like there's really awesome stuff. It's, and in the opening scene, this girl, she's born as a sex slave outside of the culture. So she's in a society that doesn't adhere to the cultural values. She tries to kill the guy who is her like master, but he kills her, but unbeknownst to her, when she was traveling on a ship through the culture Like he'll say like crazy things. Like X keeps being like, like bubble car, bubble car. And I'm like, and you know, I'm like, what's a bubble car? Like, but like, it doesn't like, but I don't want to be like, no, you're wrong. I'm like, you're thinking of weird, crazy shit. Like, I don't know what a bubble car is, but like. It's creating worlds and they might be internally consistent. And through that, you might discover something fundamental about this world. Yeah, or he'll like rewrite songs, like with words that he prefers. So like, instead of baby shark, he says baby car. It's like. Maybe he's onto something. Let me ask the big, ridiculous question. We were kind of dancing around it, but what do you think is the meaning of this whole thing we have here of human civilization, of life on earth, but in general, just life? What's the meaning of life? C. Have you, did you read Nova Scene yet? By James Lovelock? You're doing a lot of really good book recommendations here. I haven't even finished this, so I'm a huge fraud yet again. But like really early in the book, he says this amazing thing. Like, I feel like everyone's so sad and cynical. Like everyone's like the Fermi paradox and everyone. I just keep hearing people being like, fuck, what if we're alone? Like, oh no, ah, like, ah, ah. And I'm like, okay, but like, wait, what if this is the beginning? Like in Nova Scene, he says, this is not gonna be a correct, I can't like memorize quotes, but he says something like, what if our consciousness, like right now, like this is the universe waking up? Like what if instead of discovering the universe, this is the universe, like this is the evolution of the literal universe herself. Like we are not separate from the universe. Like this is the universe waking up. This is the universe seeing herself for the first time. Like this is. The universe becoming conscious. The first time we were a part of that. Yeah, cause it's like, we aren't separate from the universe. Like this could be like an incredibly sacred moment and maybe like social media and all this things, the stuff where we're all getting connected together. Like maybe these are the neurons connecting of the like collective super intelligence that is, Waking up. The, yeah, like, you know, it's like, maybe instead of something cynical or maybe if there's something to discover, like maybe this is just, you know, we're a blast assist of like some incredible kind of consciousness or being. And just like in the first three years of life or for human children, we'll forget about all the suffering that we're going through now. I think we'll probably forget about this. I mean, probably, you know, artificial intelligence will eventually render us obsolete. I don't think they'll do it in a malicious way, but I think probably we are very weak. The sun is expanding. Like, I don't know, like, hopefully we can get to Mars, but like, we're pretty vulnerable. And I, you know, like, I think we can coexist for a long time with AI and we can also probably make ourselves less vulnerable, but, you know, I just think consciousness, sentience, self awareness, like, I think this might be the single greatest like moment in evolution ever. And like, maybe this is, you know, the big, like the true beginning of life. And we're just, we're the blue green algae or we're like the single celled organisms of something amazing. The universe awakens and this is it. Yeah. Well, see, you're an incredible person. You're a fascinating mind. You should definitely do, your friend Liv mentioned that you guys were thinking of maybe talking. I would love it if you explored your mind in this kind of media more and more by doing a podcast with her or just in any kind of way. So you're an awesome person. It's an honor to know you. It's an honor to get to sit down with you late at night, which is like surreal. And I really enjoyed it. Thank you for talking today. Yeah, no, I mean, huge honor. I feel very underqualified to be here, but I'm a big fan. I've been listening to the podcast a lot and yeah, me and Liv would appreciate any advice and help and we're definitely gonna do that. So yeah. Anytime. Thank you. Cool, thank you. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Grimes. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from Oscar Wilde. Yes, I'm a dreamer. For a dreamer is one who can only find her way by moonlight and her punishment is that she sees the dawn before the rest of the world. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time. with him one day, a ship put a neural lace in her head and neural lace is sort of like, it's basically a Neuralink because life imitates art. It does indeed. It does indeed. So she wakes up and the opening scene is her memory has been uploaded by this neural lace when she has been killed. And now she gets to choose a new body. And this AI is interfacing with her recorded memory in her neural lace and helping her and being like, hello, you're dead. But because you had a neural lace, your memory's uploaded. Do you want to choose a new body? And you're going to be born here in the culture and like start a new life, which is just, that's like the opening. It's like so sick. And the ship is the super intelligence. All the ships are kind of super intelligence. But they still want to preserve a kind of rich, fulfilling experience for the humans. Yeah, like they're like friends with the humans. And then there's a bunch of ships that don't want to exist with biological beings, but they just have their own place like way over there. But they don't, they just do their own thing. They're not necessarily. So it's a pretty, this protopian existence is pretty peaceful. Yeah, I mean, and then, for example, one of the main fights in the book is they're fighting, there's these artificial hells that, and people don't think it's ethical to have artificial hell. Like basically when people do crime, they get sent, like when they die, their memory gets sent to an artificial hell and they're eternally tortured. And so, and then the way that society is deciding whether or not to have the artificial hell is that they're having these simulated, they're having like a simulated war. So instead of actual blood, you know, people are basically essentially fighting in a video game to choose the outcome of this. But they're still experiencing the suffering in this artificial hell or no? Can you experience stuff or? So the artificial hell sucks. And a lot of people in the culture want to get rid of the artificial hell. There's a simulated wars, are they happening in the artificial hell? So no, the simulated wars are happening outside of the artificial hell, between the political factions who are, so this political faction says we should have simulated hell to deter crime. And this political faction is saying, no, simulated hell is unethical. And so instead of like having, you know, blowing each other up with nukes, they're having like a giant Fortnite battle to decide this, which, you know, to me that's protopia. That's like, okay, we can have war without death. You know, I don't think there should be simulated hells. I think that is definitely one of the ways in which technology could go very, very, very, very wrong. So almost punishing people in a digital space or something like that. Yeah, like torturing people's memories. So either as a deterrent, like if you committed a crime, but also just for personal pleasure, if there's some sick, demented humans in this world. Dan Carlin actually has this episode of Hardcore History on painful attainment. Oh, that episode is fucked. It's dark, because he kind of goes through human history and says like, we as humans seem to enjoy, secretly enjoy or used to be openly enjoy sort of the torture and the death, watching the death and torture of other humans. I do think if people were consenting, we should be allowed to have gladiatorial matches. But consent is hard to achieve in those situations. It always starts getting slippery. Like it could be also forced consent, like it starts getting weird. There's way too much excitement. Like this is what he highlights. There's something about human nature that wants to see that violence. And it's really dark. And you hope that we can sort of overcome that aspect of human nature, but that's still within us somewhere. Well, I think that's what we're doing right now. I have this theory that what is very important about the current moment is that all of evolution has been survival of the fittest up until now. And at some point, the lines are kind of fuzzy, but in the recent past, or maybe even just right now, we're getting to this point where we can choose intelligent design. Like we probably since like the integration of the iPhone, like we are becoming cyborgs. Like our brains are fundamentally changed. Everyone who grew up with electronics, we are fundamentally different from previous, from homo sapiens. I call us homo techno. I think we have evolved into homo techno, which is like essentially a new species. Like if you look at the way, if you took an MRI of my brain and you took an MRI of like a medieval brain, I think it would be very different the way that it has evolved. Do you think when historians look back at this time, they'll see like this was a fundamental shift to what a human being is? I think, I do not think we are still homo sapiens. I believe we are homo techno. And I think we have evolved. And I think right now, the way we are evolving, we can choose how we do that. And I think we are being very reckless about how we're doing that. Like we're just having social media, but I think this idea that like this is a time to choose intelligent design should be taken very seriously. It like now is the moment to reprogram the human computer. It's like, if you go blind, your visual cortex will get taken over with other functions. We can choose our own evolution. We can change the way our brains work. And so we actually have a huge responsibility to do that. And I think I'm not sure who should be responsible for that, but there's definitely not adequate education. We're being inundated with all this technology that is fundamentally changing the physical structure of our brains. And we are not adequately responding to that to choose how we wanna evolve. And we could evolve, we could be really whatever we want. And I think this is a really important time. And I think if we choose correctly and we choose wisely, consciousness could exist for a very long time and integration with AI could be extremely positive. And I don't think enough people are focusing on this specific situation. Do you think we might irreversibly screw things up if we get things wrong now? Because the flip side of that, it seems humans are pretty adaptive. So maybe the way we figure things out is by screwing it up, like social media. Over a generation, we'll see the negative effects of social media, and then we build new social medias, and we just keep improving stuff. And then we learn from the failures of the past. Because humans seem to be really adaptive. On the flip side, we can get it wrong in a way where literally we create weapons of war or increase hate. Past a certain threshold, we really do a lot of damage. I mean, I think we're optimized to notice the negative things. But I would actually say one of the things that I think people aren't noticing is if you look at Silicon Valley and you look at the technocracy, like what's been happening there. When Silicon Valley started, it was all just Facebook and all this for profit crap that really wasn't particular. I guess it was useful, but it's sort of just whatever. But now you see lab grown meat, compostable, or biodegradable, single use cutlery, or meditation apps. I think we are actually evolving and changing, and technology is changing. I think there just maybe there isn't quite enough education about this. And also, I don't know if there's quite enough incentive for it because I think the way capitalism works, what we define as profit, we're also working on an old model of what we define as profit. I really think if we changed the idea of profit to include social good, you can have economic profit, social good also counting as profit would incentivize things that are more useful and more whatever spiritual technology or positive technology or things that help reprogram a human computer in a good way or things that help us intelligently design our new brains. Yeah, there's no reason why within the framework of capitalism, the word profit or the idea of profit can't also incorporate the well being of a human being. So like long term well being, long term happiness. Or even for example, we were talking about motherhood, like part of the reason I'm so late is because I had to get the baby to bed. And it's like, I keep thinking about motherhood, how under capitalism, it's like this extremely essential job that is very difficult that is not compensated. And we sort of like value things by how much we compensate them. And so we really devalue motherhood in our society and pretty much all societies. Like capitalism does not recognize motherhood. It's just a job that you're supposed to do for free. And it's like, but I feel like producing great humans should be seen as a great, as profit under capitalism. Like that should be, that's like a huge social good. Like every awesome human that gets made adds so much to the world. So like if that was integrated into the profit structure, then, you know, and if we potentially found a way to compensate motherhood. So come up with a compensation that's much broader than just money or. Or it could just be money. Like, what if you just made, I don't know, but I don't know how you'd pay for that. Like, I mean, that's where you start getting into. Reallocation of resources that people get upset over. Well, like what if we made like a motherhood Dow? Yeah, yeah. And, you know, used it to fund like single mothers, like, you know, pay for making babies. So, I mean, if you create and put beautiful things onto the world, that could be companies, that can be bridges, that could be art, that could be a lot of things, and that could be children, which are. Or education or. Anything, that should be valued by society, and that should be somehow incorporated into the framework of what, as a market, of what. Like, if you contribute children to this world, that should be valued and respected and sort of celebrated, like, proportional to what it is, which is, it's the thing that fuels human civilization. Yeah, like I. It's kind of important. I feel like everyone's always saying, I mean, I think we're in very different social spheres, but everyone's always saying, like, dismantle capitalism. And I'm like, well, okay, well, I don't think the government should own everything. Like, I don't think we should not have private ownership. Like, that's scary. You know, like that starts getting into weird stuff and just sort of like, I feel there's almost no way to do that without a police state, you know? But obviously, capitalism has some major flaws. And I think actually Mac showed me this idea called social capitalism, which is a form of capitalism that just like considers social good to be also profit. Like, you know, it's like, right now companies need to, like, you're supposed to grow every quarter or whatever to like show that you're functioning well, but it's like, okay, well, what if you kept the same amount of profit? You're still in the green, but then you have also all this social good. Like, do you really need all this extra economic growth or could you add this social good and that counts? And, you know, I don't know if, I am not an economist. I have no idea how this could be achieved, but. I don't think economists know how anything could be achieved either, but they pretend. It's the thing, they construct a model and they go on TV shows and sound like an expert. That's the definition of economist. How did being a mother, becoming a mother change you as a human being, would you say? Man, I think it kind of changed everything and it's still changing me a lot. It's actually changing me more right now in this moment than it was before. Like today, like this? Just like in the most recent months and stuff. Can you elucidate that, how change, like when you wake up in the morning and you look at yourself, it's again, which, who are you? How have you become different, would you say? I think it's just really reorienting my priorities. And at first I was really fighting against that because I somehow felt it was like a failure of feminism or something. Like I felt like it was like bad if like my kids started mattering more than my work. And then like more recently I started sort of analyzing that thought in myself and being like, that's also kind of a construct. It's like, we've just devalued motherhood so much in our culture that like, I feel guilty for caring about my kids more than I care about my work. So feminism includes breaking out of whatever the construct is. So just continually breaking, it's like freedom empower you to be free. And that means... But it also, but like being a mother, like I'm so much more creative. Like I cannot believe the massive amount of brain growth that I am. Why do you think that is? Just cause like the stakes are higher somehow? I think it's like, it's just so trippy watching consciousness emerge. It's just like, it's like going on a crazy journey or something. It's like the craziest science fiction novel you could ever read. It's just so crazy watching consciousness come into being. And then at the same time, like you're forced to value your time so much. Like when I have creative time now, it's so sacred. I need to like be really fricking on it. But the other thing is that I used to just be like a cynic and I used to just wanna... Like my last album was called Miss Anthropocene and it was like this like, it was like a study in villainy or like it was like, well, what if we have, instead of the old gods, we have like new gods and it's like Miss Anthropocene is like misanthrope like and Anthropocene, which is like the, you know, like and she's the goddess of climate change or whatever. And she's like destroying the world. And it was just like, it was like dark and it was like a study in villainy. And it was sort of just like, like I used to like have no problem just making cynical, angry, scary art. And not that there's anything wrong with that, but I think having kids just makes you such an optimist. It just inherently makes you wanna be an optimist so bad that like I feel more responsibility to make more optimistic things. And I get a lot of shit for it because everyone's like, oh, you're so privileged. Stop talking about like pie in the sky, stupid concepts and focus on like the now. But it's like, I think if we don't ideate about futures that could be good, we won't be able to get them. If everything is Blade Runner, then we're gonna end up with Blade Runner. It's like, as we said earlier, life imitates art. Like life really does imitate art. And so we really need more protopian or utopian art. I think this is incredibly essential for the future of humanity. And I think the current discourse where that's seen as a thinking about protopia or utopia is seen as a dismissal of the problems that we currently have. I think that is an incorrect mindset. And like having kids just makes me wanna imagine amazing futures that like maybe I won't be able to build, but they will be able to build if they want to. Yeah, it does seem like ideation is a precursor to creation. So you have to imagine it in order to be able to build it. And there is a sad thing about human nature that somehow a cynical view of the world is seen as a insightful view. You know, cynicism is often confused for insight, which is sad to see. And optimism is confused for naivete. Yes, yes. Like you don't, you're blinded by your, maybe your privilege or whatever. You're blinded by something, but you're certainly blinded. That's sad, that's sad to see because it seems like the optimists are the ones that create our future. They're the ones that build. In order to build the crazy thing, you have to be optimistic. You have to be either stupid or excited or passionate or mad enough to actually believe that it can be built. And those are the people that built it. My favorite quote of all time is from Star Wars, Episode 8, which I know everyone hates. Do you like Star Wars, Episode 8? No, yeah, probably I would say I would probably hate it, yeah. I don't have strong feelings about it. Let me backtrack. I don't have strong feelings about Star Wars. I'm a Tolkien person. I'm more into dragons and orcs and ogres. Yeah, I mean, Tolkien forever. I really want to have one more son and call him, I thought Tao Tecno Tolkien would be cool. It's a lot of T's, I like it. Yeah, and well, and Tao is six, two, eight, two pi. Yeah, Tao Tecno, yeah, yeah, yeah. And then techno is obviously the best genre of music, but also like technocracy. It just sounds really good. Yeah, that's right, and techno Tolkien, Tao Tecno Tolkien. That's a good, that's it. Tao Tecno Tolkien, but Star Wars, Episode 8, I know a lot of people have issues with it. Personally, on the record, I think it's the best Star Wars film. You're starting trouble today. Yeah, but don't kill what you hate, save what you love. Don't kill what you hate. Don't kill what you hate, save what you love. And I think we're, in society right now, we're in a diagnosis mode. We're just diagnosing and diagnosing and diagnosing, and we're trying to kill what we hate, and we're not trying to save what we love enough. And there's this Buckminster Fuller quote, which I'm gonna butcher, because I don't remember it correctly, but it's something along the lines of, don't try to destroy the old bad models, render them obsolete with better models. Maybe we don't need to destroy the oil industry. Maybe we just create a great new battery technology and sustainable transport, and just make it economically unreasonable to still continue to rely on fossil fuels. It's like, don't kill what you hate, save what you love. Make new things and just render the old things unusable. It's like if the college debt is so bad, and universities are so expensive, and I feel like education is becoming obsolete. I feel like we could completely revolutionize education, and we could make it free. And it's like, you look at JSTOR, and you have to pay to get all the studies and everything. What if we created a DAO that bought JSTOR, or we created a DAO that was funding studies, and those studies were open source, or free for everyone. And what if we just open sourced education and decentralized education and made it free, and all research was on the internet, and all the outcomes of studies were on the internet, and no one has student debt, and you just take tests when you apply for a job, and if you're qualified, then you can work there. This is just like, I don't know how anything works. I'm just randomly ranting, but. I like the humility. You gotta think from just basic first principles. What is the problem? What's broken? What are some ideas? That's it. And get excited about those ideas, and share your excitement, and don't tear each other down. It's just when you kill things, you often end up killing yourself. Like war is not a one sided, like you're not gonna go in and just kill them, like you're gonna get stabbed. It's like, and I think when I talk about this nexus point of that we're in this point in society where we're switching to intelligent design, I think part of our switch to intelligent design is that we need to choose nonviolence. And we need to, like, I think we can choose to start, I don't think we can eradicate violence from our species, because I think we need it a little bit, but I think we can choose to really reorient our primitive brains that are fighting over scarcity, and that are so attack oriented, and move into, we can optimize for creativity and building. Yeah, it's interesting to think how that happens, so some of it is just education, some of it is living life and introspecting your own mind, and trying to live up to the better angels of your nature for each one of us, all those kinds of things at scale. That's how we can sort of start to minimize the amount of destructive war in our world, and that's, to me, probably you're the same, technology is a really promising way to do that. Like, social media should be a really promising way to do that, it's a way we connect. I, you know, for the most part, I really enjoy social media. I just know all the negative stuff. I don't engage with any of the negative stuff. Just not even, like, by blocking or any of that kind of stuff, but just not letting it enter my mind. Like, just, like, when somebody says something negative, I see it, I immediately think positive thoughts about them, and I just forget they exist after that. Just move on, because, like, that negative energy, if I return the negative energy, they're going to get excited in a negative way right back, and it's just this kind of vicious cycle. But you would think technology would assist us in this process of letting go, of not taking things personally, of not engaging in the negativity, but unfortunately, social media profits from the negativity, so the current models. I mean, social media is like a gun. Like, you should take a course before you use it. Like, it's like, this is what I mean, like, when I say reprogram the human computer. Like, in school, you should learn about how social media optimizes to, you know, raise your cortisol levels and make you angry and crazy and stressed, and, like, you should learn how to have hygiene about how you use social media. But, so you can, yeah, choose not to focus on the negative stuff, but I don't know. I'm not sure social media should, I guess it should exist. I'm not sure. I mean, we're in the messy, it's the experimental phase. Like, we're working it out. Yeah, it's the early days. I don't even know, when you say social media, I don't know what that even means. We're in the very early days. I think social media is just basic human connection in the digital realm, and that, I think it should exist, but there's so many ways to do it in a bad way. There's so many ways to do it in a good way. There's all discussions of all the same human rights. We talk about freedom of speech. We talk about sort of violence in the space of digital media. We talk about hate speech. We talk about all these things that we had to figure out back in the day in the physical space. We're now figuring out in the digital space, and it's like baby stages. When the printing press came out, it was like pure chaos for a minute, you know? It's like when you inject, when there's a massive information injection into the general population, there's just gonna be, I feel like the printing press, I don't have the years, but it was like printing press came out, shit got really fucking bad for a minute, but then we got the enlightenment. And so it's like, I think we're in, this is like the second coming of the printing press. We're probably gonna have some shitty times for a minute, and then we're gonna have recalibrate to have a better understanding of how we consume media and how we deliver media. Speaking of programming the human computer, you mentioned Baby X. So there's this young consciousness coming to be, came from a cell. Like that whole thing doesn't even make sense. It came from DNA. Yeah. And then there's this baby computer that just like grows and grows and grows and grows, and now there's a conscious being with extremely impressive cognitive capabilities with, Have you met him? Yes, yeah. Yeah. He's actually really smart. He's really smart. Yeah. He's weird. Yeah. Or a baby. He does. I don't, I haven't. I don't know a lot of other babies, but he seems to be smart. Zach, I don't hang out with babies often, but this baby was very impressive. He does a lot of pranks and stuff. Oh, so he's like. Like he'll like give you a treat and then take it away and laugh and like stuff like that. So he's like a chess player. So here's a cognitive sort of, there's a computer being programmed. So he's taking in the environment, interacting with a specific set of humans. How would you, first of all, what is it? What, let me ask. I want to ask how do you program this computer? And also how do you make sense of that there's a conscious being right there that wasn't there before? It's giving me a lot of crisis thoughts. I'm thinking really hard. I think that's part of the reason it's like, I'm struggling to focus on art and stuff right now. Cause baby X is becoming conscious and like my it's just reorienting my brain. Like my brain is suddenly totally shifting of like, oh shit, like the way we raise children. Like, I hate all the baby books and everything. I hate them. Like they're, oh, the art is so bad. And like all this stuff, everything about all the aesthetics. And like, I'm just like, ah, like this is so. The programming languages we're using to program these baby computers isn't good. Yeah, like I'm thinking, and I, not that I have like good answers or know what to do, but I'm just thinking really, really hard about it. I, we recently watched Totoro with him, Studio Ghibli. And it's just like a fantastic film. And he like responded to, I know you're not supposed to show baby screens too much, but like, I think it's the most sort of like, I feel like it's the highest art baby content. Like it really speaks, there's almost no talking in it. It's really simple. Although all the dialogue is super, super, super simple, you know, and it's like a one to three year old can like really connect with it. Like it feels like it's almost aimed at like a one to three year old, but it's like great art and it's so imaginative and it's so beautiful. And like the first time I showed it to him, he was just like so invested in it, unlike I've ever, unlike anything else I'd ever shown him. Like he was just like crying when they cry and laughing when they laugh, like just like having this roller coaster of like emotions, like, and he learned a bunch of words. Like he was, and he started saying Totoro and started just saying all this stuff after watching Totoro, and he wants to watch it all the time. And I was like, man, why isn't there an industry of this? Like why aren't our best artists focusing on making art like for the birth of consciousness? Like, and that's one of the things I've been thinking I really wanna start doing. You know, I don't wanna speak before I do things too much, but like, I'm just like ages one to three, like we should be putting so much effort into that. And the other thing about Totoro is it's like, it's like better for the environment because adults love Totoro. It's such good art that everyone loves it. Like I still have all my old Totoro merch from when I was a kid. Like I literally have the most ragged old Totoro merch. Like everybody loves it, everybody keeps it. It's like, why does the art we have for babies need to suck and be not accessible to adults and then just be thrown out when, you know, they age out of it? Like, it's like, I don't know. I don't have like a fully formed thought here, but this is just something I've been thinking about a lot is like, how do we like, how do we have more Totoroesque content? Like how do we have more content like this that like is universal and everybody loves, but is like really geared to an emerging consciousness? Emerging consciousness in the first like three years of life that so much turmoil, so much evolution of mind is happening. It seems like a crucial time. Would you say to make it not suck, do you think of basically treating a child like they have the capacity to have the brilliance of an adult or even beyond that? Is that how you think of that mind or? No, cause they still, they like it when you talk weird and stuff. Like they respond better to, cause even they can imitate better when your voice is higher. Like people say like, oh, don't do baby talk. But it's like, when your voice is higher, it's closer to something they can imitate. So they like, like the baby talk actually kind of works. Like it helps them learn to communicate. I've found it to be more effective with learning words and stuff. But like, you're not speaking down to them. Like do they have the capacity\",\n          \"The following is a conversation with Sean Carroll. He's a theoretical physicist at Caltech specializing in quantum mechanics, gravity, and cosmology. He's the author of several popular books, one on the arrow of time called From Eternity to Here, one on the Higgs boson called Particle at the End of the Universe, and one on science and philosophy called The Big Picture on the Origins of Life, Meaning, and the Universe Itself. He has an upcoming book on quantum mechanics that you can preorder now called Something Deeply Hidden. He writes one of my favorite blogs on his website, preposterousuniverse.com. I recommend clicking on the Greatest Hits link that lists accessible, interesting posts on the arrow of time, dark matter, dark energy, the Big Bang, general relativity, string theory, quantum mechanics, and the big meta questions about the philosophy of science, God, ethics, politics, academia, and much, much more. Finally, and perhaps most famously, he's the host of a podcast called Mindscape that you should subscribe to and support on Patreon. Along with the Joe Rogan experience, Sam Harris's Making Sense, and Dan Carlin's Hardcore History, Sean's Mindscape podcast is one of my favorite ways to learn new ideas or explore different perspectives and ideas that I thought I understood. It was truly an honor to meet and spend a couple hours with Sean. It's a bit heartbreaking to say that for the first time ever, the audio recorder for this podcast died in the middle of our conversation. There's technical reasons for this, having to do with phantom power that I now understand and will avoid. It took me one hour to notice and fix the problem. So, much like the universe is 68% dark energy, roughly the same amount from this conversation was lost, except in the memories of the two people involved and in my notes. I'm sure we'll talk again and continue this conversation on this podcast or on Sean's. And of course, I look forward to it. This is the Artificial Intelligence podcast. If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube, iTunes, support it on Patreon, or simply connect with me on Twitter at Lex Friedman. And now, here's my conversation with Sean Carroll. What do you think is more interesting and impactful, understanding how the universe works at a fundamental level or understanding how the human mind works? You know, of course this is a crazy, meaningless, unanswerable question in some sense, because they're both very interesting and there's no absolute scale of interestingness that we can rate them on. There's a glib answer that says the human brain is part of the universe, right? And therefore, understanding the universe is more fundamental than understanding the human brain. But do you really believe that once we understand the fundamental way the universe works at the particle level, the forces, we would be able to understand how the mind works? No, certainly not. We cannot understand how ice cream works just from understanding how particles work, right? So I'm a big believer in emergence. I'm a big believer that there are different ways of talking about the world beyond just the most fundamental microscopic one. You know, when we talk about tables and chairs and planets and people, we're not talking the language of particle physics and cosmology. So, but understanding the universe, you didn't say just at the most fundamental level, right? So understanding the universe at all levels is part of that. I do think, you know, to be a little bit more fair to the question, there probably are general principles of complexity, biology, information processing, memory, knowledge, creativity that go beyond just the human brain, right? And maybe one could count understanding those as part of understanding the universe. The human brain, as far as we know, is the most complex thing in the universe. So there's, it's certainly absurd to think that by understanding the fundamental laws of particle physics, you get any direct insight on how the brain works. But then there's this step from the fundamentals of particle physics to information processing, which a lot of physicists and philosophers may be a little bit carelessly take when they talk about artificial intelligence. Do you think of the universe as a kind of a computational device? No, to be like, the honest answer there is no. There's a sense in which the universe processes information, clearly. There's a sense in which the universe is like a computer, clearly. But in some sense, I think, I tried to say this once on my blog and no one agreed with me, but the universe is more like a computation than a computer because the universe happens once. A computer is a general purpose machine, right? That you can ask it different questions, even a pocket calculator, right? And it's set up to answer certain kinds of questions. The universe isn't that. So information processing happens in the universe, but it's not what the universe is. And I know your MIT colleague, Seth Lloyd, feels very differently about this, right? Well, you're thinking of the universe as a closed system. I am. So what makes a computer more like a PC, like a computing machine is that there's a human that every once comes up to it and moves the mouse around. So input. Gives it input. Gives it input. And that's why you're saying it's just a computation, a deterministic thing that's just unrolling. But the immense complexity of it is nevertheless like processing. There's a state and then it changes with good rules. And there's a sense for a lot of people that if the brain operates, the human brain operates within that world, then it's simply just a small subset of that. And so there's no reason we can't build arbitrarily great intelligences. Yeah. Do you think of intelligence in this way? Intelligence is tricky. I don't have a definition of it offhand. So I remember this panel discussion that I saw on YouTube. I wasn't there, but Seth Lloyd was on the panel. And so was Martin Rees, the famous astrophysicist. And Seth gave his shtick for why the universe is a computer and explained this. And Martin Rees said, so what is not a computer? And Seth was like, oh, that's a good question. I'm not sure. Because if you have a sufficiently broad definition of what a computer is, then everything is, right? And the simile or the analogy gains force when it excludes some things. You know, is the moon going around the earth performing a computation? I can come up with definitions in which the answer is yes, but it's not a very useful computation. I think that it's absolutely helpful to think about the universe in certain situations, certain contexts, as an information processing device. I'm even guilty of writing a paper called Quantum Circuit Cosmology, where we modeled the whole universe as a quantum circuit. As a circuit. As a circuit, yeah. With qubits kind of thing? With qubits basically, right, yeah. So, and qubits becoming more and more entangled. So do we wanna digress a little bit? Let's do it. It's kind of fun. So here's a mystery about the universe that is so deep and profound that nobody talks about it. Space expands, right? And we talk about, in a certain region of space, a certain number of degrees of freedom, a certain number of ways that the quantum fields and the particles in that region can arrange themselves. That number of degrees of freedom in a region of space is arguably finite. We actually don't know how many there are, but there's a very good argument that says it's a finite number. So as the universe expands and space gets bigger, are there more degrees of freedom? If it's an infinite number, it doesn't really matter. Infinity times two is still infinity. But if it's a finite number, then there's more space, so there's more degrees of freedom. So where did they come from? That would mean the universe is not a closed system. There's more degrees of freedom popping into existence. So what we suggested was that there are more degrees of freedom, and it's not that they're not there to start, but they're not entangled to start. So the universe that you and I know of, the three dimensions around us that we see, we said those are the entangled degrees of freedom making up space time. And as the universe expands, there are a whole bunch of qubits in their zero state that become entangled with the rest of space time through the action of these quantum circuits. So what does it mean that there's now more degrees of freedom as they become more entangled? Yeah, so. As the universe expands. That's right, so there's more and more degrees of freedom that are entangled, that are playing part, playing the role of part of the entangled space time structure. So the basic, the underlying philosophy is that space time itself arises from the entanglement of some fundamental quantum degrees of freedom. Wow, okay, so at which point is most of the entanglement happening? Are we talking about close to the Big Bang? Are we talking about throughout the time of the life? Throughout history, yeah. So the idea is that at the Big Bang, almost all the degrees of freedom that the universe could have were there, but they were unentangled with anything else. And that's a reflection of the fact that the Big Bang had a low entropy. It was a very simple, very small place. And as space expands, more and more degrees of freedom become entangled with the rest of the world. Well, I have to ask John Carroll, what do you think of the thought experiment from Nick Bostrom that we're living in a simulation? So I think, let me contextualize that a little bit more. I think people don't actually take this thought experiments. I think it's quite interesting. It's not very useful, but it's quite interesting. From the perspective of AI, a lot of the learning that can be done usually happens in simulation from artificial examples. And so it's a constructive question to ask, how difficult is our real world to simulate? Right. Which is kind of a dual part of, if we're living in a simulation and somebody built that simulation, if you were to try to do it yourself, how hard would it be? So obviously we could be living in a simulation. If you just want the physical possibility, then I completely agree that it's physically possible. I don't think that we actually are. So take this one piece of data into consideration. You know, we live in a big universe, okay? There's two trillion galaxies in our observable universe with 200 billion stars in each galaxy, et cetera. It would seem to be a waste of resources to have a universe that big going on just to do a simulation. So in other words, I want to be a good Bayesian. I want to ask under this hypothesis, what do I expect to see? So the first thing I would say is I wouldn't expect to see a universe that was that big, okay? The second thing is I wouldn't expect the resolution of the universe to be as good as it is. So it's always possible that if our superhuman simulators only have finite resources, that they don't render the entire universe, right? That the part that is out there, the two trillion galaxies, isn't actually being simulated fully, okay? But then the obvious extrapolation of that is that only I am being simulated fully. Like the rest of you are just non player characters, right? I'm the only thing that is real. The rest of you are just chat bots. Beyond this wall, I see the wall, but there is literally nothing on the other side of the wall. That is sort of the Bayesian prediction. That's what it would be like to do an efficient simulation of me. So like none of that seems quite realistic. I don't see, I hear the argument that it's just possible and easy to simulate lots of things. I don't see any evidence from what we know about our universe that we look like a simulated universe. Now, maybe you can say, well, we don't know what it would look like, but that's just abandoning your Bayesian responsibilities. Like your job is to say under this theory, here's what you would expect to see. Yeah, so certainly if you think about simulation as a thing that's like a video game where only a small subset is being rendered. But say the entire, all the laws of physics, the entire closed system of the quote unquote universe, it had a creator. Yeah, it's always possible. Right, so that's not useful to think about when you're thinking about physics. The way Nick Bostrom phrases it, if it's possible to simulate a universe, eventually we'll do it. Right. You can use that by the way for a lot of things. Well, yeah. But I guess the question is, how hard is it to create a universe? I wrote a little blog post about this and maybe I'm missing something, but there's an argument that says not only that it might be possible to simulate a universe, but probably if you imagine that you actually attribute consciousness and agency to the little things that we're simulating, to our little artificial beings, there's probably a lot more of them than there are ordinary organic beings in the universe or there will be in the future, right? So there's an argument that not only is being a simulation possible, it's probable because in the space of all living consciousnesses, most of them are being simulated, right? Most of them are not at the top level. I think that argument must be wrong because it follows from that argument that, if we're simulated, but we can also simulate other things, well, but if we can simulate other things, they can simulate other things, right? If we give them enough power and resolution and ultimately we'll reach a bottom because the laws of physics in our universe have a bottom, we're made of atoms and so forth, so there will be the cheapest possible simulations. And if you believe the original argument, you should conclude that we should be in the cheapest possible simulation because that's where most people are. But we don't look like that. It doesn't look at all like we're at the edge of resolution, that we're 16 bit things. It seems much easier to make much lower level things than we are. And also, I questioned the whole approach to the anthropic principle that says we are typical observers in the universe. I think that that's not actually, I think that there's a lot of selection that we can do that we're typical within things we already know, but not typical within all of the universe. So do you think there's intelligent life, however you would like to define intelligent life, out there in the universe? My guess is that there is not intelligent life in the observable universe other than us, simply on the basis of the fact that the likely number of other intelligent species in the observable universe, there's two likely numbers, zero or billions. And if there had been billions, you would have noticed already. For there to be literally like a small number, like, you know, Star Trek, there's a dozen intelligent civilizations in our galaxy, but not a billion, that's weird. That's sort of bizarre to me. It's easy for me to imagine that there are zero others because there's just a big bottleneck to making multicellular life or technological life or whatever. It's very hard for me to imagine that there's a whole bunch out there that have somehow remained hidden from us. The question I'd like to ask is what would intelligent life look like? What I mean by that question and where it's going is what if intelligent life is just in some very big ways different than the one that has on Earth? That there's all kinds of intelligent life that operates at different scales of both size and temporal. Right, that's a great possibility because I think we should be humble about what intelligence is, what life is. We don't even agree on what life is, much less what intelligent life is, right? So that's an argument for humility, saying there could be intelligent life of a very different character, right? Like you could imagine the dolphins are intelligent but never invent space travel because they live in the ocean and they don't have thumbs, right? So they never invent technology, they never invent smelting. Maybe the universe is full of intelligent species that just don't make technology, right? That's compatible with the data, I think. And I think maybe what you're pointing at is even more out there versions of intelligence, intelligence in intermolecular clouds or on the surface of a neutron star or in between the galaxies in giant things where the equivalent of a heartbeat is 100 million years. On the one hand, yes, we should be very open minded about those things. On the other hand, all of us share the same laws of physics. There might be something about the laws of physics, even though we don't currently know exactly what that thing would be, that makes meters and years the right length and timescales for intelligent life. Maybe not, but we're made of atoms, atoms have a certain size, we orbit stars or stars have a certain lifetime. It's not impossible to me that there's a sweet spot for intelligent life that we find ourselves in. So I'm open minded either way, I'm open minded either being humble and there's all sorts of different kinds of life or no, there's a reason we just don't know it yet why life like ours is the kind of life that's out there. Yeah, I'm of two minds too, but I often wonder if our brains is just designed to quite obviously to operate and see the world in these timescales and we're almost blind and the tools we've created for detecting things are blind to the kind of observation needed to see intelligent life at other scales. Well, I'm totally open to that, but so here's another argument I would make, we have looked for intelligent life, but we've looked at for it in the dumbest way we can, by turning radio telescopes to the sky. And why in the world would a super advanced civilization randomly beam out radio signals wastefully in all directions into the universe? That just doesn't make any sense, especially because in order to think that you would actually contact another civilization, you would have to do it forever, you have to keep doing it for millions of years, that sounds like a waste of resources. If you thought that there were other solar systems with planets around them, where maybe intelligent life didn't yet exist, but might someday, you wouldn't try to talk to it with radio waves, you would send a spacecraft out there and you would park it around there and it would be like, from our point of view, it'd be like 2001, where there was a monolith. Monolith. There could be an artifact, in fact, the other way works also, right? There could be artifacts in our solar system that have been put there by other technologically advanced civilizations and that's how we will eventually contact them. We just haven't explored the solar system well enough yet to find them. The reason why we don't think about that is because we're young and impatient, right? Like, it would take more than my lifetime to actually send something to another star system and wait for it and then come back. So, but if we start thinking on hundreds of thousands of years or million year time scales, that's clearly the right thing to do. Are you excited by the thing that Elon Musk is doing with SpaceX in general? Space, but the idea of space exploration, even though your, or your species is young and impatient? Yeah. No, I do think that space travel is crucially important, long term. Even to other star systems. And I think that many people overestimate the difficulty because they say, look, if you travel 1% the speed of light to another star system, we'll be dead before we get there, right? And I think that it's much easier. And therefore, when they write their science fiction stories, they imagine we'd go faster than the speed of light because otherwise they're too impatient, right? We're not gonna go faster than the speed of light, but we could easily imagine that the human lifespan gets extended to thousands of years. And once you do that, then the stars are much closer effectively, right? And then what's a hundred year trip, right? So I think that that's gonna be the future, the far future, not my lifetime once again, but baby steps. Unless your lifetime gets extended. Well, it's in a race against time, right? A friend of mine who actually thinks about these things said, you know, you and I are gonna die, but I don't know about our grandchildren. That's, I don't know, predicting the future is hard, but that's at least a plausible scenario. And so, yeah, no, I think that as we discussed earlier, there are threats to the earth, known and unknown, right? Having spread humanity and biology elsewhere is a really important longterm goal. What kind of questions can science not currently answer, but might soon? When you think about the problems and the mysteries before us that may be within reach of science. I think an obvious one is the origin of life. We don't know how that happened. There's a difficulty in knowing how it happened historically actually, you know, literally on earth, but starting life from non life is something I kind of think we're close to, right? We're really. You really think so? Like how difficult is it to start life? Well, I've talked to people, including on the podcast about this. You know, life requires three things. Life as we know it. So there's a difference with life, which who knows what it is, and life as we know it, which we can talk about with some intelligence. So life as we know it requires compartmentalization. You need like a little membrane around your cell. Metabolism, you need to take in food and eat it and let that make you do things. And then replication, okay? So you need to have some information about who you are that you pass down to future generations. In the lab, compartmentalization seems pretty easy. Not hard to make lipid bilayers that come into little cellular walls pretty easily. Metabolism and replication are hard, but replication we're close to. People have made RNA like molecules in the lab that I think the state of the art is, they're not able to make one molecule that reproduces itself, but they're able to make two molecules that reproduce each other. So that's okay. That's pretty close. Metabolism is harder, believe it or not, even though it's sort of the most obvious thing, but you want some sort of controlled metabolism and the actual cellular machinery in our bodies is quite complicated. It's hard to see it just popping into existence all by itself. It probably took a while, but we're making progress. And in fact, I don't think we're spending nearly enough money on it. If I were the NSF, I would flood this area with money because it would change our view of the world if we could actually make life in the lab and understand how it was made originally here on earth. And I'm sure it'd have some ripple effects that help cure disease and so on. I mean, just that understanding. So synthetic biology is a wonderful big frontier where we're making cells. Right now, the best way to do that is to borrow heavily from existing biology, right? Well, Craig Venter several years ago created an artificial cell, but all he did was, not all he did, it was a tremendous accomplishment, but all he did was take out the DNA from a cell and put in entirely new DNA and let it boot up and go. What about the leap to creating intelligent life on earth? Yeah. Again, we define intelligence, of course, but let's just even say Homo sapiens, the modern intelligence in our human brain. Do you have a sense of what's involved in that leap and how big of a leap that is? So AI would count in this, or do you really want life? Do you want really an organism in some sense? AI would count, I think. Okay. Yeah, of course, of course AI would count. Well, let's say artificial consciousness, right? So I do not think we are on the threshold of creating artificial consciousness. I think it's possible. I'm not, again, very educated about how close we are, but my impression is not that we're really close because we understand how little we understand of consciousness and what it is. So if we don't have any idea what it is, it's hard to imagine we're on the threshold of making it ourselves. But it's doable, it's possible. I don't see any obstacles in principle. So yeah, I would hold out some interest in that happening eventually. I think in general, consciousness, I think we would be just surprised how easy consciousness is once we create intelligence. I think consciousness is a thing that's just something we all fake. Well, good. No, actually, I like this idea that in fact, consciousness is way less mysterious than we think because we're all at every time, at every moment, less conscious than we think we are, right? We can fool things. And I think that plus the idea that you not only have artificial intelligent systems, but you put them in a body, right, give them a robot body, that will help the faking a lot. Yeah, I think creating consciousness in artificial consciousness is as simple as asking a Roomba to say, I'm conscious, and refusing to be talked out of it. Could be, it could be. And I mean, I'm almost being silly, but that's what we do. That's what we do with each other. This is the kind of, that consciousness is also a social construct. And a lot of our ideas of intelligence is a social construct. And so reaching that bar involves something that's beyond, that doesn't necessarily involve the fundamental understanding of how you go from electrons to neurons to cognition. No, actually, I think that is an extremely good point. And in fact, what it suggests is, so yeah, you referred to Kate Darling, who I had on the podcast, and who does these experiments with very simple robots, but they look like animals, and they can look like they're experiencing pain, and we human beings react very negatively to these little robots looking like they're experiencing pain. And what you wanna say is, yeah, but they're just robots. It's not really pain, right? It's just some electrons going around. But then you realize, you and I are just electrons going around, and that's what pain is also. And so what I would have an easy time imagining is that there is a spectrum between these simple little robots that Kate works with and a human being, where there are things that sort of by some strict definition, Turing test level thing are not conscious, but nevertheless walk and talk like they're conscious. And it could be that the future is, I mean, Siri is close, right? And so it might be the future has a lot more agents like that. And in fact, rather than someday going, aha, we have consciousness, we'll just creep up on it with more and more accurate reflections of what we expect. And in the future, maybe the present, for example, we haven't met before, and you're basically assuming that I'm human as it's a high probability at this time because the yeah, but in the future, there might be question marks around that, right? Yeah, no, absolutely. Certainly videos are almost to the point where you shouldn't trust them already. Photos you can't trust, right? Videos is easier to trust, but we're getting worse that, we're getting better at faking them, right? Yeah, so physical embodied people, what's so hard about faking that? So this is very depressing, this conversation we're having right now. So I mean, To me, it's exciting. To me, you're doing it. So it's exciting to you, but it's a sobering thought. We're very bad, right? At imagining what the next 50 years are gonna be like when we're in the middle of a phase transition as we are right now. Yeah, and I, in general, I'm not blind to all the threats. I am excited by the power of technology to solve, to protect us against the threats as they evolve. I'm not as much as Steven Pinker optimistic about the world, but in everything I've seen, all of the brilliant people in the world that I've met are good people. So the army of the good in terms of the development of technology is large. Okay, you're way more optimistic than I am. I think that goodness and badness are equally distributed among intelligent and unintelligent people. I don't see much of a correlation there. Interesting. Neither of us have proof. Yeah, exactly. Again, opinions are free, right? Nor definitions of good and evil. We come without definitions or without data opinions. So what kind of questions can science not currently answer and may never be able to answer in your view? Well, the obvious one is what is good and bad? What is right and wrong? I think that there are questions that, science tells us what happens, what the world is and what it does. It doesn't say what the world should do or what we should do, because we're part of the world. But we are part of the world and we have the ability to feel like something's right, something's wrong. And to make a very long story very short, I think that the idea of moral philosophy is systematizing our intuitions of what is right and what is wrong. And science might be able to predict ahead of time what we will do, but it won't ever be able to judge whether we should have done it or not. So, you're kind of unique in terms of scientists. Listen, it doesn't have to do with podcasts, but even just reaching out, I think you referred to as sort of doing interdisciplinary science. So you reach out and talk to people that are outside of your discipline, which I always hope that's what science was for. In fact, I was a little disillusioned when I realized that academia is very siloed. Yeah. And so the question is, how, at your own level, how do you prepare for these conversations? How do you think about these conversations? How do you open your mind enough to have these conversations? And it may be a little bit broader, how can you advise other scientists to have these kinds of conversations? Not at the podcast, the fact that you're doing a podcast is awesome, other people get to hear them, but it's also good to have it without mics in general. It's a good question, but a tough one to answer. I think about a guy I know who's a personal trainer, and he was asked on a podcast, how do we psych ourselves up to do a workout? How do we make that discipline to go and work out? And he's like, why are you asking me? I can't stop working out. I don't need to psych myself up. So, and likewise, he asked me, how do you get to have interdisciplinary conversations on all sorts of different things, all sorts of different people? I'm like, that's what makes me go, right? Like that's, I couldn't stop doing that. I did that long before any of them were recorded. In fact, a lot of the motivation for starting recording it was making sure I would read all these books that I had purchased, right? Like all these books I wanted to read, not enough time to read them. And now if I have the motivation, cause I'm gonna interview Pat Churchland, I'm gonna finally read her book. You know, and it's absolutely true that academia is extraordinarily siloed, right? We don't talk to people. We rarely do. And in fact, when we do, it's punished. You know, like the people who do it successfully generally first became very successful within their little siloed discipline. And only then did they start expanding out. If you're a young person, you know, I have graduate students. I try to be very, very candid with them about this, that it's, you know, most graduate students are to not become faculty members, right? It's a tough road. And so live the life you wanna live, but do it with your eyes open about what it does to your job chances. And the more broad you are and the less time you spend hyper specializing in your field, the lower your job chances are. That's just an academic reality. It's terrible, I don't like it, but it's a reality. And for some people, that's fine. Like there's plenty of people who are wonderful scientists who have zero interest in branching out and talking to things, to anyone outside their field. But it is disillusioning to me. Some of the, you know, romantic notion I had of the intellectual academic life is belied by the reality of it. The idea that we should reach out beyond our discipline and that is a positive good is just so rare in universities that it may as well not exist at all. But that said, even though you're saying you're doing it like the personal trainer, because you just can't help it, you're also an inspiration to others. Like I could speak for myself. You know, I also have a career I'm thinking about, right? And without your podcast, I may have not have been doing this at all, right? So it makes me realize that these kinds of conversations is kind of what science is about in many ways. The reason we write papers, this exchange of ideas, is it's much harder to do interdisciplinary papers, I would say. And conversations are easier. So conversations is the beginning. And in the field of AI, it's obvious that we should think outside of pure computer vision competitions on a particular data sets. We should think about the broader impact of how this can be, you know, reaching out to physics, to psychology, to neuroscience and having these conversations so that you're an inspiration. And so never know how the world changes. I mean, the fact that this stuff is out there and I've a huge number of people come up to me, grad students, really loving the podcast, inspired by it. And they will probably have that, they'll be ripple effects when they become faculty and so on and so on. We can end on a balance between pessimism and optimism.

theres a nonzero probability that i talked to the other michael jordan given my connection to and love of the chicago bulls of the 90s but if i had to pick one im going with the michael jordan of statistics and computer science or as yann lecun calls him the miles davis of machine learning in his blog post titled artificial intelligence the revolution hasnt happened yet michael argues for broadening the scope of the artificial intelligence field in many ways the underlying spirit of this podcast is the same to see artificial intelligence as a deeply human endeavor to not only engineer algorithms and robots but to understand and empower human beings at all levels of abstraction from the individual to our civilization as a whole this is the artificial intelligence podcast if you

youre one of the greats in the field of ai machine learning computer science and so on youre trivially called the michael jordan of machine learning although as you know you were born first so technically mj is the michael i jordan of basketball but anyway my favorite is yann lecun calling you the miles davis of machine learning because as he says you reinvent yourself periodically and sometimes leave fans scratching their heads after you change direction so can you put at first your historian hat on and give a history of computer science and ai as you saw it as you experienced it including the four generations of ai successes that ive seen you talk about sure yeah first of all i much prefer yanns metaphor miles davis was a real explorer in jazz and he had a coherent story so i think i have one but its not just the one you lived its the one you think about later what the historian does is they look back and they revisit i think whats happening right now is not ai that was an intellectual aspiration thats still alive today as an aspiration but i think this is akin to the development of chemical engineering from chemistry or electrical engineering from electromagnetism so if you go back to the 30s or 40s there wasnt yet chemical engineering there was chemistry there was fluid flow there was mechanics and so on but people pretty clearly viewed interesting goals to try to build factories that make chemicals products and do it viably safely make good ones do it at scale so people started to try to do that of course and some factories worked some didnt some were not viable some exploded but in parallel developed a whole field called chemical engineering electrical engineering is a field its no bones about it it has theoretical aspects to it it has practical aspects its not just engineering quote unquote its the real thing real concepts are needed same thing with electrical engineering there was maxwells equations which in some sense were everything you know about electromagnetism but you needed to figure out how to build circuits how to build modules how to put them together how to bring electricity from one point to another safely and so on and so forth so a whole field that developed called electrical engineering i think thats whats happening right now is that we have a proto field which is statistics more of the theoretical side of it algorithmic side of computer science that was enough to start to build things but what things systems that bring value to human beings and use human data and mix in human decisions the engineering side of that is all ad hoc thats whats emerging in fact if you wanna call machine learning a field i think thats what it is that its a proto form of engineering based on statistical and computational ideas of previous generations but do you think theres something deeper about ai in his dreams and aspirations as compared to chemical engineering and electrical engineering well the dreams and aspirations maybe but those are 500 years from now i think that thats like the greeks sitting there and saying it would be neat to get to the moon someday i think we have no clue how the brain does computation were just a clueless were even worse than the greeks on most anything interesting scientifically of our era can you linger on that just for a moment because you stand not completely unique but a little bit unique in the clarity of that can you elaborate your intuition of why were like where we stand in our understanding of the human brain and a lot of people say you know scientists say were not very far in understanding human brain but youre like youre saying were in the dark here well i know im not unique i dont even think in the clarity but if you talk to real neuroscientists that really study real synapses or real neurons they agree they agree its a hundreds of year task and theyre building it up slowly and surely what the signal is there is not clear we think we have all of our metaphors we think its electrical maybe its chemical its a whole soup its ions and proteins and its a cell and thats even around like a single synapse if you look at a electron micrograph of a single synapse its a city of its own and thats one little thing on a dendritic tree which is extremely complicated electrochemical thing and its doing these spikes and voltages are flying around and then proteins are taking that and taking it down into the dna and who knows what so it is the problem of the next few centuries it is fantastic but we have our metaphors about it is it an economic device is it like the immune system or is it like a layered set of you know arithmetic computations we have all these metaphors and theyre fun but thats not real science per se there is neuroscience thats not neuroscience all right thats like the greek speculating about how to get to the moon fun right and i think that i like to say this fairly strongly because i think a lot of young people think were on the verge because a lot of people who dont talk about it clearly let it be understood that yes we kind of this is a brain inspired were kind of close you know breakthroughs are on the horizon and thats scrupulous people sometimes who need money for their labs thats what im saying scrupulous but people will oversell i need money for my lab im studying computational neuroscience im going to oversell it and so theres been too much of that so ill step into the gray area between metaphor and engineering with im not sure if youre familiar with brain computer interfaces so a company like elon musk has neuralink thats working on putting electrodes into the brain and trying to be able to read both read and send electrical signals just as you said even the basic mechanism of communication in the brain is not something we understand but do you hope without understanding the fundamental principles of how the brain works well be able to do something interesting at that gray area of metaphor its not my area so i hope in the sense like anybody else hopes for some interesting things to happen from research i would expect more something like alzheimers will get figured out from modern neuroscience theres a lot of human suffering based on brain disease and we throw things like lithium at the brain it kind of works no one has a clue why thats not quite true but mostly we dont know and thats even just about the biochemistry of the brain and how it leads to mood swings and so on how thought emerges from that we were really really completely dim so that you might want to hook up electrodes and try to do some signal processing on that and try to find patterns fine by all means go for it its just not scientific at this point so its like kind of sitting in a satellite and watching the emissions from a city and trying to infer things about the microeconomy even though you dont have microeconomic concepts its really that kind of thing and so yes can you find some signals that do something interesting or useful can you control a cursor or mouse with your brain yeah absolutely and then i can imagine business models based on that and even medical applications of that but from there to understanding algorithms that allow us to really tie in deeply from the brain to computer i just no i dont agree with elon musk i dont think thats even thats not for our generations not even for the century so just in hopes of getting you to dream youve mentioned kolmogorov and turing might pop up do you think that there might be breakthroughs that will get you to sit back in five 10 years and say wow oh im sure there will be but i dont think that therell be demos that impress me i dont think that having a computer call a restaurant and pretend to be a human is a breakthrough right and people you know some people present it as such its imitating human intelligence its even putting coughs in the thing to make a bit of a pr stunt and so fine that the world runs on those things too and i dont want to diminish all the hard work and engineering that goes behind things like that and the ultimate value to the human race but thats not scientific understanding and i know the people that work on these things they are after scientific understanding in the meantime theyve got to kind of you know the trains got to run and they got mouths to feed and they got things to do and theres nothing wrong with all that i would call that though just engineering and i want to distinguish that between an engineering field like electrical engineering and chemical engineering that originally emerged that had real principles and you really know what youre doing and you had a little scientific understanding maybe not even complete so it became more predictable and it really gave value to human life because it was understood and so we dont want to muddle too much these waters of you know what were able to do versus what we really cant do in a way thats going to impress the next so i dont need to be wowed but i think that someone comes along in 20 years a younger person whos absorbed all the technology and for them to be wowed i think they have to be more deeply impressed a young kolmogorov would not be wowed by some of the stunts that you see right now coming from the big companies the demos but do you think the breakthroughs from kolmogorov would be and give this question a chance do you think therell be in the scientific fundamental principles arena or do you think its possible to have fundamental breakthroughs in engineering meaning you know i would say some of the things that elon musk is working with spacex and then others sort of trying to revolutionize the fundamentals of engineering of manufacturing of saying heres a problem we know how to do a demo of and actually taking it to scale yeah so theres going to be all kinds of breakthroughs i just dont like that terminology im a scientist and i work on things day in and day out and things move along and eventually you say wow something happened but i dont like that language very much also i dont like to prize theoretical breakthroughs over practical ones i tend to be more of a theoretician and i think theres lots to do in that arena right now and so i wouldnt point to the kolmogorovs i might point to the edisons of the era and maybe musk is a bit more like that but you know musk god bless him also will say things about ai that he knows very little about and he leads people astray when he talks about things he doesnt know anything about trying to program a computer to understand natural language to be involved in a dialogue were having right now that aint going to happen in our lifetime you could fake it you can mimic sort of take old sentences that humans use and retread them but the deep understanding of language no its not going to happen and so from that i hope you can perceive that the deeper yet deeper kind of aspects and intelligence are not going to happen now will there be breakthroughs no i think that google was a breakthrough i think amazon is a breakthrough you know i think uber is a breakthrough you know that bring value to human beings at scale in new brand new ways based on data flows and so on a lot of these things are slightly broken because theres not kind of an engineering field that takes economic value in context of data and you know planetary scale and worries about all the externalities the privacy you know we dont have that field so we dont think these things through very well i see that as emerging and that will be you know looking back from 100 years that will be a constituted breakthrough in this era just like electrical engineering was a breakthrough in the early part of the last century and chemical engineering was a breakthrough so the scale the markets that you talk about and well get to will be seen as sort of breakthrough and were in the very early days of really doing interesting stuff there and well get to that but just taking a quick step back can you give kind of throw off the historian hat i mean you briefly said that the history of ai kind of mimics the history of chemical engineering but i keep saying machine learning you keep wanting to say ai just to let you know i dont you know i resist that i dont think this is about ai really was john mccarthy as almost a philosopher saying wouldnt it be cool if we could put thought in a computer if we could mimic the human capability to think or put intelligence in in some sense into a computer thats an interesting philosophical question and he wanted to make it more than philosophy he wanted to actually write down a logical formula and algorithms that would do that and that is a perfectly valid reasonable thing to do thats not whats happening in this era so the reason i keep saying ai actually and id love to hear what you think about it machine learning has a very particular set of methods and tools maybe your version of it is that mine doesnt its very very open it does optimization it does sampling it does so systems that learn is what machine learning is systems that learn and make decisions and make decisions so its not just pattern recognition and you know finding patterns its all about making decisions in real worlds and having close feedback loops so something like symbolic ai expert systems reasoning systems knowledge based representation all of those kinds of things search does that neighbor fit into what you think of as machine learning so i dont even like the word machine learning i think that what the field youre talking about is all about making large collections of decisions under uncertainty by large collections of entities right and there are principles for that at that scale you dont have to say the principles are for a single entity thats making decisions single agent or single human it really immediately goes to the network of decisions is a good word for that or no no theres no good words for any of this thats kind of part of the problem so we can continue the conversation to use ai for all that i just want to kind of raise the flag here that this is not about we dont know what intelligence is and real intelligence we dont know much about abstraction and reasoning at the level of humans we dont have a clue were not trying to build that because we dont have a clue eventually it may emerge theyll make i dont know if therell be breakthroughs but eventually well start to get glimmers of that its not whats happening right now okay were taking data were trying to make good decisions based on that were trying to scale were trying to economically viably were trying to build markets were trying to keep value at that scale and aspects of this will look intelligent computers were so dumb before they will seem more intelligent we will use that buzzword of intelligence so we can use it in that sense so machine learning you can scope it narrowly as just learning from data and pattern recognition but when i talk about these topics maybe data science is another word you could throw in the mix it really is important that the decisions are as part of it its consequential decisions in the real world am i going to have a medical operation am i going to drive down the street things where theres scarcity things that impact other human beings or other environments and so on how do i do that based on data how do i do that adaptively how do i use computers to help those kinds of things go forward whatever you want to call that so lets call it ai lets agree to call it ai but lets not say that the goal of that is intelligence the goal of that is really good working systems at planetary scale that weve never seen before so reclaim the word ai from the dartmouth conference from many decades ago of the dream of humans i dont want to reclaim it i want a new word i think it was a bad choice i mean if you read one of my little things the history was basically that mccarthy needed a new name because cybernetics already existed and he didnt like no one really liked norbert wiener norbert wiener was kind of an island to himself and he felt that he had encompassed all this and in some sense he did you look at the language of cybernetics it was everything were talking about it was control theory and signal processing and some notions of intelligence and closed feedback loops and data it was all there its just not a word that lived on partly because of the maybe the personalities but mccarthy needed a new word to say im different from you im not part of your show i got my own invented this word and again thinking forward about the movies that would be made about it it was a great choice but thinking forward about creating a sober academic and real world discipline it was a terrible choice because it led to promises that are not true that we understand we understand artificial perhaps but we dont understand intelligence its a small tangent because youre one of the great personalities of machine learning whatever the heck you call the field do you think science progresses by personalities or by the fundamental principles and theories and research thats outside of personalities both and i wouldnt say there should be one kind of personality i have mine and i have my preferences and i have a kind of network around me that feeds me and some of them agree with me and some of them disagree but all kinds of personalities are needed right now i think the personality that its a little too exuberant a little bit too ready to promise the moon is a little bit too much in ascendance and i do think that theres some good to that it certainly attracts lots of young people to our field but a lot of those people come in with strong misconceptions and they have to then unlearn those and then find something to do and so i think theres just got to be some multiple voices and i wasnt hearing enough of the more sober voice so as a continuation of a fun tangent and speaking of vibrant personalities what would yeah and you think technically speaking its possible to help i dont know the answers but its a its a its a less anonymity a little more locality you know worlds that you kind of enter in and you trust the people there in those worlds so that when you start having a discussion you know not only is that people are not going to hurt you but its not going to be a total waste of your time because theres a lot of wasting of time that you know a lot of us i pulled out of facebook early on cause it was clearly going to waste a lot of my time even though there was some value and so yeah worlds that are somehow you enter in and you know what youre getting and its kind of appeals to you and you might new things might happen but you kind of have some some trust in that world and theres some deep interesting complex psychological aspects around anonymity how that changes human behavior thats quite dark quite dark yeah i think a lot of us are especially those of us who really loved the advent of technology i love social networks when they came out i was just i didnt see any negatives there at all but then i started seeing comment sections i think it was maybe you know with the cnn or something and i started to go wow this this darkness i just did not know about and and our technology is now amplifying it so sorry for the big philosophical question but on that topic do you think human beings cause youve also out of all things had a foot in psychology too the do you think human beings are fundamentally good like all of us have good intent that could be mind or is it depending on context and environment everybody could be evil so my answer is fundamentally good but fundamentally limited all of us have very you know blinkers on we dont see the other persons pain that easily we dont see the other persons point of view that easily were very much in our own head in our own world and on my good days i think the technology could open us up to you know more perspectives and more less blinkered and more understanding you know a lot of wars in human history happened because of just ignorance they didnt they they thought the other person was doing this while their person wasnt doing this and we have a huge amounts of that but in my lifetime ive not seen technology really help in that way yet and i do i do i do believe in that but you know no i think fundamentally humans are good the people suffer people have grievances because you have grudges and those things cause them to do things they probably wouldnt want they regret it often so no i i think its a you know part of the progress of technology is to indeed allow it to be a little easier to be the real good person you actually are well but do you think individual human life or society could be modeled as an optimization problem not the way i think typically i mean thats youre talking about one of the most complex phenomenon in the whole you know in all of which the individual human life or society as a whole both both i mean individual human life is amazingly complex and so you know optimization is kind of just one branch of mathematics that talks about certain kinds of things and it just feels way too limited for the complexity of such things what properties of optimization problems do you think so do you think most interesting problems that could be solved through optimization what kind of properties does that surface have non convexity convexity linearity all those kinds of things saddle points well so optimization is just one piece of mathematics you know theres like you just even in our era were aware that say sampling is coming up examples of something coming up with a distribution whats optimization whats sampling well they you can if youre a kind of a certain kind of mathematician you can try to blend them and make them seem to be sort of the same thing but optimization is roughly speaking trying to find a point that a single point that is the optimum of a criterion function of some kind and sampling is trying to from that same surface treat that as a distribution or density and find points that have high density so i want the entire distribution in a sampling paradigm and i want the you know the single point thats the best point in the optimization paradigm now if you were optimizing in the space of probability measures the output of that could be a whole probability distribution so you can start to make these things the same but in mathematics if you go too high up that kind of abstraction hierarchy you start to lose the you know the ability to do the interesting theorems so you kind of dont try that you dont try to overly over abstract so as a small tangent what kind of worldview do you find more appealing one that is deterministic or stochastic well thats easy i mean im a statistician you know the world is highly stochastic i dont know whats going to happen in the next five minutes right because what youre going to ask what were going to do what ill say due to the uncertainty due to the massive uncertainty yeah you know massive uncertainty and so the best i can do is have come rough sense or probability distribution on things and somehow use that in my reasoning about what to do now so how does the distributed at scale when you have multi agent systems look like so optimization can optimize sort of it makes a lot more sense sort of at least from my from robotics perspective for a single robot for a single agent trying to optimize some objective function when you start to enter the real world this game theoretic concept starts popping up thats how do you see optimization in this because youve talked about markets in a scale what does that look like do you see it as optimization do you see it as sampling do you see like how should you mark these all blend together and a system designer thinking about how to build an incentivized system will have a blend of all these things so you know a particle in a potential well is optimizing a functional called a lagrangian right the particle doesnt know that theres no algorithm running that does that it just happens and so its a description mathematically of something that helps us understand as analysts whats happening right and so the same thing will happen when we talk about you know mixtures of humans and computers and markets and so on and so forth therell be certain principles that allow us to understand whats happening whether or not the actual algorithms are being used by any sense is not clear now at some point i may have set up a multi agent or market kind of system and im now thinking about an individual agent in that system and theyre asked to do some task and theyre incentivized in some way they get certain signals and they have some utility what they will do at that point is they just wont know the answer they may have to optimize to find an answer okay so an artist could be embedded inside of an overall market you know and game theory is very very broad it is often studied very narrowly for certain kinds of problems but its roughly speaking this is just the i dont know what youre going to do so i kind of anticipate that a little bit and you anticipate what im anticipating and we kind of go back and forth in our own minds we run kind of thought experiments youve talked about this interesting point in terms of game theory you know most optimization problems really hate saddle points maybe you can describe what saddle points are but ive heard you kind of mentioned that theres a theres a branch of optimization that you could try to explicitly look for saddle points as a good thing oh not optimization thats just game theory that that so theres all kinds of different equilibria in game theory and some of them are highly explanatory behavior theyre not attempting to be algorithmic theyre just trying to say if you happen to be at this equilibrium you would see certain kind of behavior and we see that in real life thats what an economist wants to do especially behavioral economists in continuous differential game theory youre in continuous spaces a some of the simplest equilibria are saddle points and nash equilibrium as a saddle point its a special kind of saddle point so classically in game theory you were trying to find nash equilibria and an algorithmic game theory youre trying to find algorithms that would find them and so youre trying to find saddle points i mean so thats literally what youre trying to do but you know any economist knows that nash equilibria have their limitations they are definitely not that explanatory in many situations theyre not what you really want theres other kind of equilibria and theres names associated with these because they came from history with certain people working on them but there will be new ones emerging so you know one example is a stackelberg equilibrium so you know nash you and i are both playing this game against each other or for each other maybe its cooperative and were both going to think it through and then were going to decide and were going to do our thing simultaneously you know in a stackelberg no im going to be the first mover im going to make a move youre going to look at my move and then youre going to make yours now since i know youre going to look at my move i anticipate what youre going to do and so i dont do something stupid but then i know that you are also anticipating me so were kind of going back and forth on why but there is then a first mover thing and so those are different equilibria right and so just mathematically yeah these things have certain topologies and certain shapes that are like whats it algorithmically or dynamically how do you move towards them how do you move away from things you know so some of these questions have answers theyve been studied others do not and especially if it becomes stochastic especially if theres large numbers of decentralized things theres just you know young people get in this field who kind of think its all done because we have you know tensorflow well no these are all open problems and theyre really important and interesting and its about strategic settings how do i collect data suppose i dont know what youre going to do because i dont know you very well right well i got to collect data about you so maybe i want to push you into a part of the space where i dont know much about you so i can get data cause and then later ill realize that youll never youll never go there because of the way the game is set up you know thats part of the overall you know data analysis context is that even the game of poker is fascinating space whenever theres any uncertainty a lack of information its a super exciting space just to linger on optimization for a second so when we look at deep learning its essentially minimization of a complicated loss function so is there something insightful or hopeful that you see in the kinds of function surface that loss functions the deep learning and in the real world is trying to optimize over is there something interesting as its just the usual kind of problems of optimization i think from an optimization point of view that surface first of all its pretty smooth and secondly if theres over if its over parameterized theres kind of lots of paths down to reasonable optima and so kind of the getting downhill to the to an optimum is viewed as not as hard as you mightve expected in high dimensions the fact that some optima tend to be really good ones and others not so good and you tend to its not sometimes you find the good ones is sort of still needs explanation yeah but but the particular surface is coming from the particular generation of neural nets i kind of suspect those will those will change in 10 years it will not be exactly those surfaces therell be some others that are an optimization theory will help contribute to why other surfaces or why other algorithms years of arithmetic operations with a little bit of nonlinearity thats not that didnt come from neuroscience per se i mean maybe in the minds of some of the people working on it they were thinking about brains but they were arithmetic circuits in all kinds of fields computer science control theory and so on and that layers of these could transform things in certain ways and that if its smooth maybe you could find parameter values is a sort of big discovery that its working its able to work at this scale but i dont think that were stuck with that and were were certainly not stuck with that cause were understanding the brain so in terms of on the algorithm side sort of gradient descent do you think were stuck with gradient descent as a variance of it what variance do you find interesting or do you think therell be something else invented that is able to walk all over these optimization spaces in more interesting ways so theres a co design of the surface and the or the architecture and the algorithm so if you just ask if we stay with the kind of architectures that we have now and not just neural nets but you know phase retrieval architectures or matrix completion architectures and so on you know i think weve kind of come to a place where yeah a stochastic gradient algorithms are dominant and there are versions that are a little better than others they have more guarantees theyre more robust and so on and theres ongoing research to kind of figure out which is the best arm for which situation but i think that thatll start to co evolve that thatll put pressure on the actual architecture and so we shouldnt do it in this particular way we should do it in a different way because this other algorithm is now available if you do it in a different way so that i cant really anticipate that co evolution process but you know gradients are amazing mathematical objects they have a lot of people who start to study them more deeply mathematically are kind of shocked about what they are and what they can do think about it this way suppose that i tell you if you move along the x axis you go uphill in some objective by three units whereas if you move along the y axis you go uphill by seven units right now im going to only allow you to move a certain unit distance right what are you going to do well most people will say that im going to go along the y axis im getting the biggest bang for my buck you know and my buck is only one unit so im going to put all of it in the y axis right and why should i even take any of my strength my step size and put any of it in the x axis because im getting less bang for my buck that seems like a completely clear argument and its wrong because the gradient direction is not to go along the y axis its to take a little bit of the x axis and to understand that you have to know some math and so even a trivial so called operator like gradient is not trivial and so you know exploiting its properties is still very important now we know that just pervading descent has got all kinds of problems it gets stuck in many ways and it had never you know good dimension dependence and so on so my own line of work recently has been about what kinds of stochasticity how can we get dimension dependence how can we do the theory of that and weve come up pretty favorable results with certain kinds of stochasticity we have sufficient conditions generally we know if you do this we will give you a good guarantee we dont have necessary conditions that it must be done a certain way in general so stochasticity how much randomness to inject into the walking along the gradient and what kind of randomness why is randomness good in this process why is stochasticity good yeah so i can give you simple answers but in some sense again its kind of amazing stochasticity just you know particular features of a surface that could have hurt you if you were doing one thing deterministically wont hurt you because by chance theres very little chance that you would get hurt so here stochasticity it just kind of saves you from some of the particular features of surfaces in fact if you think about surfaces that are discontinuous in our first derivative like an absolute value function you will go down and hit that point where theres nondifferentiability and if youre running a deterministic algorithm at that point you can really do something bad whereas stochasticity just means its pretty unlikely thats going to happen that youre going to hit that point so its again nontrivial to analyze but especially in higher dimensions also stochasticity our intuition isnt very good about it but it has properties that kind of are very appealing in high dimensions for a lot of large number of reasons so its all part of the mathematics to kind of thats whats fun to work in the field is that you get to try to understand this mathematics but long story short you know partly empirically it was discovered stochastic gradient is very effective and theory kind of followed id say that but i dont see that were getting clearly out of that whats the most beautiful mysterious a profound idea to you in optimization i dont know the most but let me just say that nesterovs work on nesterov acceleration to me is pretty surprising and pretty deep can you elaborate well nesterov acceleration is just that suppose that we are going to use gradients to move around in a space for the reasons ive alluded to theyre nice directions to move and suppose that i tell you that youre only allowed to use gradients youre not going to be allowed to use this local person that can only sense kind of the change in the surface but im going to give you kind of a computer thats able to store all your previous gradients and so you start to learn some something about the surface and im going to restrict you to maybe move in the direction of like a linear span of all the gradients so you cant kind of just move in some arbitrary direction right so now we have a well defined mathematical complexity model theres certain classes of algorithms that can do that and others that cant and we can ask for certain kinds of surfaces how fast can you get down to the optimum so theres answers to these so for a smooth convex function theres an answer which is one over the number of steps squared you will be within a ball of that size after k steps gradient descent in particular has a slower rate its one over k so you could ask is gradient descent actually even though we know its a good algorithm is it the best algorithm and the answer is no well not clear yet because one over k squared is a lower bound thats probably the best you can do gradient is one over k but is there something better and so i think as a surprise to most nesterov discovered a new algorithm that has got two pieces to it its two gradients and puts those together in a certain kind of obscure way and the thing doesnt even move downhill all the time it sometimes goes back uphill and if youre a physicist that kind of makes some sense youre building up some momentum and that is kind of the right intuition but that intuition is not enough to understand kind of how to do it and why it works but it does it achieves one over k squared and it has a mathematical structure and its still kind of to this day a lot of us are writing papers and trying to explore that and understand it so there are lots of cool ideas and optimization but just kind of using gradients i think is number one that goes back you know 150 years and then nesterov i think has made a major contribution with this idea so like you said gradients themselves are in some sense mysterious theyre not as trivial as not as trivial coordinate descent is more of a trivial one you just pick one of the coordinates thats how we think thats how our human mind thinks thats how our human minds think and gradients are not that easy for our human mind to grapple with an absurd question but what is statistics so here its a little bit its somewhere between math and science and technology its somewhere in that convex hole so its a set of principles that allow you to make inferences that have got some reason to be believed and also principles that allow you to make decisions where you can have some reason to believe youre not going to make errors so all of that requires some assumptions about what do you mean by an error what do you mean by the probabilities but after you start making some of those assumptions youre led to conclusions that yes i can guarantee that if you do this in this way your probability of making an error will be small your probability of continuing to not make errors over time will be small and the probability that you found something thats real will be small will be high so decision making is a big part of that decision making is a big part yeah so statistics short history was that it goes back as a formal discipline 250 years or so it was called inverse probability because around that era probability was developed sort of especially to explain gambling situations of course interesting so you would say well given the state of nature is this theres a certain roulette board that has a certain mechanism and what kind of outcomes do i expect to see and especially if i do things long amounts of time what outcomes will i see and the physicists started to pay attention to this and then people said well lets turn the problem around what if i saw certain outcomes could i infer what the underlying mechanism was thats an inverse problem and in fact for quite a while statistics was called inverse probability that was the name of the field and i believe that it was laplace who was working in napoleons government who needed to do a census of france learn about the people there so he went and gathered data and he analyzed that data to determine policy and said well lets call this field that does this kind of thing statistics because the word state is in there in french thats etat but its the study of data for the state so anyway that caught on and its been called statistics ever since but by the time it got formalized it was sort of in the 30s and around that time there was game theory and decision theory developed nearby people in that era didnt think of themselves as either computer science or statistics or control or econ they were all the above and so von neumann is developing game theory but also thinking of that as decision theory wald is an econometrician developing decision theory and then turning that into statistics and so its all about heres not just data and you analyze it heres a loss function heres what you care about heres the question youre trying to ask here is a probability model and heres the risk you will face if you make certain decisions and to this day in most advanced statistical curricula you teach decision theory as the starting point and then it branches out into the two branches of bayesian and frequentist but thats all about decisions in statistics what is the most beautiful mysterious maybe surprising idea that youve come across yeah good question i mean theres a bunch of surprising ones theres something thats way too technical for this thing but something called james stein estimation which is kind of surprising and really takes time to wrap your head around can you try to maybe i think i dont want to even want to try let me just say a colleague at steven stigler at university of chicago wrote a really beautiful paper on james stein estimation which helps to its views a paradox it kind of defeats the minds attempts to understand it but you can and steve has a nice perspective on that so one of the troubles with statistics is that its like in physics that are in quantum physics you have multiple interpretations theres a wave and particle duality in physics and you get used to that over time but it still kind of haunts you that you dont really quite understand the relationship the electrons a wave and electrons a particle well the same thing happens here theres bayesian ways of thinking and frequentist and they are different they sometimes become sort of the same in practice but they are physically different and then in some practice they are not the same at all they give you rather different answers and so it is very much like wave and particle duality and that is something that you have to kind of get used to in the field can you define bayesian and frequentist yeah in decision theory you can make i have a video that people could see its called are you a bayesian or a frequentist and kind of help try to make it really clear it comes from decision theory so you know decision theory youre talking about loss functions which are a function of data x and parameter theta theyre a function of two arguments okay neither one of those arguments is known you dont know the data a priori its random and the parameters unknown all right so you have a function of two things you dont know and youre trying to say i want that function to be small i want small loss right well what are you going to do so you sort of say well im going to average over these quantities or maximize over them or something so that you know i turn that uncertainty into something certain so you could look at the first argument and average over it or you could look at the second argument and average over it thats bayesian and frequentist so the frequentist says im going to look at the x the data and im going to take that as random and im going to average over the distribution so i take the expectation loss under x theta is held fixed right thats called the risk and so its looking at other all the data sets you could get right and say how well will a certain procedure do under all those data sets thats called a frequentist guarantee right so i think it is very appropriate when like youre building a piece of software and youre shipping it out there and people are using it on all kinds of data sets you want to have a stamp a guarantee on it that as people run it on many many data sets that you never even thought about that 95 of the time it will do the right thing perfectly reasonable the bayesian perspective says well no im going to look at the other argument of the loss function the theta part okay thats unknown and im uncertain about it so i could have my own personal probability for what it is you know how many tall people are there out there im trying to infer the average height of the population while i have an idea roughly what the height is so im going to average over the theta so now that loss function as only now again one arguments gone now its a function of x and thats what a bayesian does is they say well lets just focus on the particular x we got the data set we got we condition on that conditional on the x i say something about my loss thats a bayesian approach to things and the bayesian will argue that its not relevant to look at all the other data sets you could have gotten and average over them the frequentist approach its really only the data sets you got right and i do agree with that especially in situations where youre working with a scientist you can learn a lot about the domain and youre really only focused on certain kinds of data and you gathered your data and you make inferences i dont agree with it though that you know in the sense that there are needs for frequentist guarantees youre writing software people are using it out there you want to say something so these two things have to got to fight each other a little bit but they have to blend so long story short theres a set of ideas that are right in the middle that are called empirical bayes and empirical bayes sort of starts with the bayesian framework its kind of arguably philosophically more you know reasonable and kosher write down a bunch of the math that kind of flows from that and then realize theres a bunch of things you dont know because its the real world and you dont know everything so youre uncertain about certain quantities at that point ask is there a reasonable way to plug in an estimate for those things okay and in some cases theres quite a reasonable thing to do to plug in theres a natural thing you can observe in the world that you can plug in and then do a little bit more mathematics and assure yourself its really good so based on math or based on human expertise whats what what are good oh theyre both going in the bayesian framework allows you to put a lot of human expertise in but the math kind of guides you along that path and then kind of reassures you the end you could put that stamp of approval under certain assumptions this thing will work so you asked the question whats my favorite you know or whats the most surprising nice idea so one that is more accessible is something called false discovery rate which is you know youre making not just one hypothesis test or making one decision youre making a whole bag of them and in that bag of decisions you look at the ones where you made a discovery you announced that something interesting had happened all right thats going to be some subset of your big bag in the ones you made a discovery which subset of those are bad or false false discoveries youd like the fraction of your false discoveries among your discoveries to be small thats a different criterion than accuracy or precision or recall or sensitivity and specificity its a different quantity those latter ones are almost all of them have more of a frequentist flavor they say given the truth is that the null hypothesis is true heres what accuracy i would get or given that the alternative is true heres what i would get so its kind of going forward from the state of nature to the data the bayesian goes the other direction from the data back to the state of nature and thats actually what false discovery rate is it says given you made a discovery okay thats conditioned on your data whats the probability of the hypothesis its going the other direction and so the classical frequency look at that well i cant know that theres some priors needed in that and the empirical bayesian goes ahead and plows forward and starts writing down these formulas and realizes at some point some of those things can actually be estimated in a reasonable way and so its kind of its a beautiful set of ideas so i this kind of line of argument has come out its not certainly mine but it sort of came out from robbins around 1960 brad efron has written beautifully about this in various papers and books and the fdr is you know benjamin in israel john story did this bayesian interpretation and so on and he used to absorb these things over the years and find it a very healthy way to think about statistics let me ask you about intelligence to jump slightly back out into philosophy perhaps you said that maybe you can elaborate but you said that defining just even the question of what is intelligence is a very difficult question is it a useful question do you think well one day understand the fundamentals of human intelligence and what it means you know have good benchmarks for general intelligence that we put before our machines so i dont work on these topics so much that youre really asking the question for a psychologist really and i studied some but i dont consider myself at least an expert at this point you know a psychologist aims to understand human intelligence right and i think many psychologists i know are fairly humble about this they might try to understand how a baby understands you know whether somethings a solid or liquid or whether somethings hidden or not and maybe how a child starts to learn the meaning of certain words whats a verb whats a noun and also you know slowly but surely trying to figure out things but humans ability to take a really complicated environment reason about it abstract about it find the right abstractions communicate about it interact and so on is just you know really staggeringly rich and complicated and so you know i think in all humility we dont think were kind of aiming for that in the near future a certain psychologist doing experiments with babies in the lab or with people talking has a much more limited aspiration and you know kahneman and tversky would look at our reasoning patterns and theyre not deeply understanding all the how we do our reasoning but theyre sort of saying hey heres some oddities about the reasoning and some things you should think about it but also as i emphasize in some things ive been writing about you know ai the revolution hasnt happened yet yeah great blog post ive been emphasizing that you know if you step back and look at intelligent systems of any kind and whatever you mean by intelligence its not just the humans or the animals or you know the plants or whatever you know so a market that brings goods into a city you know food to restaurants or something every day is a system its a decentralized set of decisions looking at it from far enough away its just like a collection of neurons every neuron is making its own little decisions presumably in some way and if you step back enough every little part of an economic system is making all of its decisions and just like with the brain who knows what an individual neuron does and what the overall goal is right but something happens at some aggregate level same thing with the economy people eat in a city and its robust it works at all scales small villages to big cities its been working for thousands of years it works rain or shine so its adaptive so all the kind of you know those are adjectives one tends to apply to intelligent systems robust adaptive you know you dont need to keep adjusting it self healing whatever plus not perfect you know intelligences are never perfect and markets are not perfect but i do not believe in this era that you cannot that you can say well our computers are our humans are smart but you know no markets are not more markets are so they are intelligent now we humans didnt evolve to be markets weve been participating in them right but we are not ourselves a market per se the neurons could be viewed as the market theres economic you know neuroscience kind of perspective thats interesting to pursue all that the point though is is that if you were to study humans and really be the worlds best psychologist studied for thousands of years and come up with the theory of human intelligence you might have never discovered principles of markets you know supply demand curves and you know matching and auctions and all that those are real principles and they lead to a form of intelligence thats not maybe human intelligence its arguably another kind of intelligence there probably are third kinds of intelligence or fourth that none of us are really thinking too much about right now so if you really and then all of those are relevant to computer systems in the future certainly the market one is relevant right now whereas the understanding of human intelligence is not so clear that its relevant right now probably not so if you want general intelligence whatever one means by that or you know understanding intelligence in a deep sense and all that it is definitely has to be not just human intelligence its gotta be this broader thing and thats not a mystery markets are intelligent so you know its definitely not just a philosophical stance to say weve got to move beyond intelligence that sounds ridiculous yeah but its not and in that blog post you define different kinds of like intelligent infrastructure ai which i really like is some of the concepts youve just been describing do you see ourselves if we see earth human civilization as a single organism do you think the intelligence of that organism when you think from the perspective of markets and intelligence infrastructure is increasing is it increasing linearly is it increasing exponentially what do you think the future of that intelligence yeah i dont know i dont tend to think i dont tend to answer questions like that because you know thats science fiction im hoping to catch you off guard well again because you said its so far in the future its fun to ask and youll probably you know like you said predicting the future is really nearly impossible but say as an axiom one day we create a human level a superhuman level intelligent not the scale of markets but the scale of an individual what do you think it is what do you think it would take to do that or maybe to ask another question is how would that system be different than the biological human beings that we see around us today is it possible to say anything interesting to that question or is it just a stupid question its not a stupid question but its science fiction science fiction and so im totally happy to read science fiction and think about it from time in my own life i loved there was this like brain in a vat kind of you know little thing that people were talking about when i was a student i remember you know imagine that you know between your brain and your body theres a you know theres a bunch of wires right and suppose that every one of them was replaced with a literal wire and then suppose that wire was turned in actually a little wireless you know theres a receiver and sender so the brain has got all the senders and receiver you know on all of its exiting you know axons and all the dendrites down to the body have replaced with senders and receivers now you could move the body off somewhere and put the brain in a vat right and then you could do things like start killing off those senders and receivers one by one and after youve killed off all of them where is that person you know they thought they were out in the body walking around the world and they moved on so those are science fiction things those are fun to think about its just intriguing about where is what is thought where is it and all that and i think every 18 year old should take philosophy classes and think about these things and i think that everyone should think about what could happen in society thats kind of bad and all that but i really dont think thats the right thing for most of us that are my age group to be doing and thinking about i really think that we have so many more present you know first challenges and dangers and real things to build and all that such that you know spending too much time on science fiction at least in public for like this i think is not what we should be doing maybe over beers in private thats right well im not going to broadcast where i have beers because this is going to go on facebook and i dont want a lot of people showing up there but yeah ill i love facebook twitter amazon youtube i have im optimistic and hopeful but maybe maybe i dont have grounds for such optimism and hope but let me ask youve mentored some of the brightest sort of some of the seminal figures in the field can you give advice to people who are undergraduates today what does it take to take you know advice on their journey if theyre interested in machine learning and in the ideas of markets from economics and psychology and all the kinds of things that youve exploring what steps should they take on that journey well yeah first of all the door is open and second its a journey i like your language there it is not that youre so brilliant and you have great brilliant ideas and therefore thats just you know thats how you have success or thats how you enter into the field its that you apprentice yourself you spend a lot of time you work on hard things you try and pull back and you be as broad as you can you talk to lots of people and its like entering in any kind of a creative community theres years that are needed and human connections are critical to it so you know i think about you know being a musician or being an artist or something you dont just you know immediately from day one you know youre a genius and therefore you do it no you you know practice really really hard on basics and you be humble about where you are and then and you realize youll never be an expert on everything so you kind of pick and theres a lot of randomness and a lot of kind of luck but luck just kind of picks out which branch of the tree you go down but youll go down some branch so yeah its a community so the graduate school is i still think is one of the wonderful phenomena that we have in our in our world its very much about apprenticeship with an advisor its very much about a group of people you belong to its a four or five year process so its plenty of time to start from kind of nothing to come up to something you know more more expertise and then to start to have your own creativity start to flower even surprising your own self and its a very cooperative endeavor i think a lot of people think of science as highly competitive and i think in some other fields it might be more so here its way more cooperative than you might imagine and people are always teaching each other something and people are always more than happy to be clear that so i feel im an expert on certain kinds of things but im very much not expert on lots of other things and a lot of them are relevant and a lot of them are i should know but should in some society you know you dont so im always willing to reveal my ignorance to people around me so they can teach me things and i think a lot of us feel that way about our field so its very cooperative i might add its also very international because its so cooperative we see no barriers and so that the nationalism that you see especially in the current era and everything is just at odds with the way that most of us think about what were doing here where this is a human endeavor and we cooperate and are very much trying to do it together for the you know the benefit of everybody so last question where and how and why did you learn french and which language is more beautiful english or french great question so first of all i think italian is actually more beautiful than french and english and i also speak that so im married to an italian and i have kids and we speak italian anyway all kidding aside every language allows you to express things a bit differently and it is one of the great fun things to do in life is to explore those things so in fact when i kids or teens or college students ask me what they study i say well do what your heart where your heart is certainly do a lot of math math is good for everybody but do some poetry and do some history and do some language too you know throughout your life youll want to be a thinking person youll want to have done that for me french i learned when i was id say a late teen i was living in the middle of the country in kansas and not much was going on in kansas with all due respect to kansas and so my parents happened to have some french books on the shelf and just in my boredom i pulled them down and i found this is fun and i kind of learned the language by reading and when i first heard it spoken i had no idea what was being spoken but i realized i had somehow knew it from some previous life and so i made the connection but then i traveled and just i love to go beyond my own barriers and my own comfort or whatever and i found myself on trains in france next to say older people who had lived a whole life of their own and the ability to communicate with them was special and the ability to also see myself in other peoples shoes and have empathy and kind of work on that language as part of that so after that kind of experience and also embedding myself in french culture which is quite amazing languages are rich not just because theres something inherently beautiful about it but its all the creativity that went into it so i learned a lot of songs read poems read books and then i was here actually at mit where were doing the podcast today and a young professor not yet married and not having a lot of friends in the area so i just didnt have i was kind of a bored person i said i heard a lot of italians around theres happened to be a lot of italians at mit an italian professor for some reason and so i was kind of vaguely understanding what they were talking about i said well i should learn this language too so i did and then later met my spouse and italian became a part of my life but i go to china a lot these days i go to asia i go to europe and every time i go i kind of am amazed by the richness of human experience and the people dont have any idea if you havent traveled kind of how amazingly rich and i love the diversity its not just a buzzword to me it really means something i love to embed myself with other peoples experiences and so yeah learning language is a big part of that i think ive said in some interview at some point that if i had millions of dollars and infinite time or whatever what would you really work on if you really wanted to do ai and for me that is natural language and really done right deep understanding of language thats to me an amazingly interesting scientific challenge one were very far away on one were very far away but good natural language people are kind of really invested then i think a lot of them see thats where the core of ai is that if you understand that you really help human communication you understand something about the human mind the semantics that come out of the human mind and i agree i think that will be such a long time so i didnt do that in my career just cause i kind of i was behind in the early days i didnt kind of know enough of that stuff i was at mit i didnt learn much language and it was too late at some point to kind of spend a whole career doing that but i admire that field and so in my little way by learning language you know kind of that part of my brain has been trained up jan was right you truly are the miles davis of machine learning i dont think theres a better place than it mike it was a huge honor talking to you today merci beaucoup all right its been my pleasure thanks for listening to this

twitter at lex friedman and now let me leave you with some words of wisdom from michael i jordan from his blog post titled artificial intelligence the revolution hasnt happened yet calling for broadening the scope of the ai field we should embrace the fact that what we are witnessing is the creation of a new branch of engineering the term engineering is often invoked in a narrow sense in academia and beyond with overtones of cold effectless machinery and negative connotations of loss of control by humans but an engineering discipline can be what we want it to be in the current era we have a real opportunity to conceive of something historically new a human centric engineering discipline i will resist giving this emerging discipline a name but if the acronym ai continues to be used lets be aware of the very real limitations of this placeholder lets broaden our scope tone down the hype and recognize the serious challenges ahead thank you for listening and hope to see you next time you say is the most interesting disagreement you have with jan lacune so jans an old friend and i just say that i dont think we disagree about very much really he and i both kind of have a lets build it kind of mentality and does it work kind of mentality and kind of concrete we both speak french and we speak french more together and we have a lot in common and so if one wanted to highlight a disagreement its not really a fundamental one i think its just kind of what were emphasizing jan has emphasized pattern recognition and has emphasized prediction and its interesting to try to take that as far as you can if you could do perfect prediction what would that give you kind of as a thought experiment and i think thats way too limited we cannot do perfect prediction we will never have the data sets that allow me to figure out what youre about ready to do what question youre going to ask next i have no clue i will never know such things moreover most of us find ourselves during the day in all kinds of situations we had no anticipation of that are kind of very very novel in various ways and in that moment we want to think through what we want and also theres going to be market forces acting on us id like to go down that street but now its full because theres a crane in the street i got it i got to think about that i got to think about what i might really want here and i got to sort of think about how much it costs me to do this action versus this action i got to think about the risks involved a lot of our current pattern recognition and prediction systems dont do any risk evaluations they have no error bars right i got to think about other peoples decisions around me i got to think about a collection of my decisions even just thinking about like a medical treatment you know im not going to take a the prediction of a neural net about my health about something consequential im not about ready to have a heart attack because some number is over 07 even if you had all the data in the world that ever been collected about heart attacks better than any doctor ever had im not going to trust the output of that neural net to predict my heart attack im going to want to ask what if questions around that im going to want to look at some us or other possible data i didnt have causal things im going to want to have a dialogue with a doctor about things we didnt think about when he gathered the data you know i could go on and on i hope you can see and i dont i think that if you say predictions everything that that that youre missing all of this stuff and so prediction plus decision making is everything but both of them are equally important and so the field has emphasized prediction jan rightly so has seen how powerful that is but at the cost of people not being aware that decision making is where the rubber really hits the road where human lives are at stake where risks are being taken where you got to gather more data you got to think about the error bars you got to think about the consequences of your decisions on others you got to think about the economy around your decisions blah blah blah blah im not the only one working on those but were a smaller tribe and right now were not the one that people talk about the most but you know if you go out in the real world and industry you know at amazon id say half the people there are working on decision making and the other half are doing you know the pattern recognition its important and the words of pattern recognition and prediction i think the distinction there not to linger on words but the distinction there is more a constrained sort of in the lab data set versus decision making is talking about consequential decisions in the real world under the messiness and the uncertainty of the real world and just the whole of it the whole mess of it that actually touches human beings and scale and the forces thats the distinction it helps add those that perspective that broader perspective youre right i totally agree on the other hand if youre a real prediction person of course you want it to be in the real world you want to predict real world events im just saying thats not possible with just data sets that it has to be in the context of you know strategic things that someones doing data they might gather things they could have gathered the reasoning process around data its not just taking data and making predictions based on the data so one of the things that youre working on im sure theres others working on it but i dont hear often it talked about especially in the clarity that you talk about it and i think its both the most exciting and the most concerning area of ai in terms of decision making so youve talked about ai systems that help make decisions that scale in a distributed way millions billions decisions sort of markets of decisions can you as a starting point sort of give an example of a system that you think about when youre thinking about these kinds of systems yeah so first of all youre absolutely getting into some territory which i will be beyond my expertise and there are lots of things that are going to be very not obvious to think about just like again i like to think about history a little bit but think about put yourself back in the sixties there was kind of a banking system that wasnt computerized really there was database theory emerging and database people had to think about how do i actually not just move data around but actual money and have it be you know valid and have transactions that atms happen that are actually you know all valid and so on and so forth so thats the kind of issues you get into when you start to get serious about sorts of things like this i like to think about as kind of almost a thought experiment to help me think something simpler which is the music market and because there is to first order there is no music market in the world right now and in our country for sure there are something called things called record companies and they make money and they prop up a few really good musicians and make them superstars and they all make huge amounts of money but theres a long tail of huge numbers of people that make lots and lots of really good music that is actually listened to by more people than the famous people they are not in a market they cannot have a career they do not make money the creators the creators the creators the so called influencers or whatever that diminishes who they are so there are people who make extremely good music especially in the hip hop or latin world these days they do it on their laptop thats what they do on the weekend and they have another job during the week and they put it up on soundcloud or other sites eventually it gets streamed it now gets turned into bits its not economically valuable the information is lost it gets put up there people stream it you walk around in a big city you see people with headphones especially young kids listening to music all the time if you look at the data very little of the music they are listening to is the famous peoples music and none of its old music its all the latest stuff but the people who made that latest stuff are like some 16 year old somewhere who will never make a career out of this who will never make money of course there will be a few counter examples the record companies incentivize to pick out a few and highlight them long story short theres a missing market there there is not a consumer producer relationship at the level of the actual creative acts the pipelines and spotifys of the world that take this stuff and stream it along they make money off of subscriptions or advertising and those things theyre making the money all right and then they will offer bits and pieces of it to a few people again to highlight that they simulate a market anyway a real market would be if youre a creator of music that you actually are somebody whos good enough that people want to listen to you you should have the data available to you there should be a dashboard showing a map of the united states so in last week heres all the places your songs were listened to it should be transparent vetable so that if someone down in providence sees that youre being listened to 10000 times in providence that they know thats real data you know its real data they will have you come give a show down there they will broadcast to the people whove been listening to you that youre coming if you do this right you could go down there and make 20000 you do that three times a year you start to have a career so in this sense ai creates jobs its not about taking away human jobs its creating new jobs because it creates a new market once youve created a market youve now connected up producers and consumers the person whos making the music can say to someone who comes to their shows a lot hey ill play at your daughters wedding for 10000 youll say 8000 theyll say 9000 then again you can now get an income up to 100000 youre not going to be a millionaire and now even think about really the value of music is in these personal connections even so much so that a young kid wants to wear a tshirt with their favorite musicians signature on it so if they listen to the music on the internet the internet should be able to provide them with a button that they push and the merchandise arrives the next day we can do that and now why should we do that well because the kid who bought the shirt will be happy but more the person who made the music will get the money theres no advertising needed so you can create markets between producers and consumers take 5 cut your company will be perfectly sound itll go forward into the future and it will create new markets and that raises human happiness now this seems like well this is easy just create this dashboard kind of create some connections and all that but if you think about uber or whatever you think about the challenges in the real world of doing things like this and there are actually new principles going to be needed youre trying to create a new kind of two way market at a different scale thats ever been done before theres going to be unwanted aspects of the market therell be bad people therell be the data will get used in the wrong ways itll fail in some ways it wont deliver about you have to think that through just like anyone who ran a big auction or ran a big matching service in economics will think these things through and so that maybe doesnt get at all the huge issues that can arise when you start to create markets but it starts to at least for me solidify my thoughts and allow me to move forward in my own thinking yeah so i talked to the head of research at spotify actually and i think their longterm goal theyve said is to have at least one million creators make a comfortable living putting on spotify so i think you articulate a really nice vision of the world and the digital and the cyberspace of markets what do you think companies like spotify or youtube or netflix can do to create such markets is it an ai problem is it an interface problem for interface design is it some other kind of is it an economics problem who should they hire to solve these problems well part of its not just top down so the silicon valley has this attitude that they know how to do it they will create the system just like google did with the search box that will be so good that theyll just everyone will adopt that its everything you said but really i think missing that kind of culture so its literally that 16 year old whos able to create the songs you dont create that as a silicon valley entity you dont hire them per se you have to create an ecosystem in which they are wanted and that they belong and so you have to have some cultural credibility to do things like this netflix to their credit wanted some of that credibility and they created shows content they call it content its such a terrible word but its culture and so with movies you can kind of go give a large sum of money to somebody graduating from the usc film school its a whole thing of its own but its kind of like rich white peoples thing to do and american culture has not been so much about rich white people its been about all the immigrants all the africans who came and brought that culture and those rhythms to this world and created this whole new thing american culture and so companies cant artificially create that they cant just say hey were here were going to buy it up youve got a partner and so anyway not to denigrate these companies are all trying and they should and im sure theyre asking these questions and some of them are even making an effort but it is partly a respect the culture as a technology person youve got to blend your technology with cultural meaning how much of a role do you think the algorithm so machine learning has in connecting the consumer to the creator sort of the recommender system aspect of this yeah its a great question i think pretty high theres no magic in the algorithms but a good recommender system is way better than a bad recommender system and recommender systems is a billion dollar industry back even 10 20 years ago and it continues to be extremely important going forward whats your favorite recommender system just so we can put something well just historically i was one of the when i first went to amazon i first didnt like amazon because they put the book people out of business or the library the local booksellers went out of business ive come to accept that there probably are more books being sold now and poor people reading them than ever before and then local book stores are coming back so thats how economics sometimes work you go up and you go down but anyway when i finally started going there and i bought a few books i was really pleased to see another few books being recommended to me that i never would have thought of and i bought a bunch of them so they obviously had a good business model but i learned things and i still to this day kind of browse using that service and i think lots of people get a lot that is a good aspect of a recommendation system im learning from my peers in an indirect way and their algorithms are not meant to have them impose what we learn it really is trying to find out whats in the data it doesnt work so well for other kinds of entities but thats just the complexity of human life like shirts im not going to get recommendations on shirts but thats interesting if you try to recommend restaurants its hard its hard to do it at scale but a blend of recommendation systems with other economic ideas matchings and so on is really really still very open research wise and theres new companies that are going to emerge that do that well what do you think is going to the messy difficult land of say politics and things like that that youtube and twitter have to deal with in terms of recommendation systems being able to suggest i think facebook just launched facebook news so recommend the kind of news that are most likely for you to be interesting do you think this is ai solvable again whatever term we want to use do you think its a solvable problem for machines or is it a deeply human problem thats unsolvable so i dont even think about it at that level i think that whats broken with some of these companies its all monetization by advertising theyre not at least facebook i want to critique them but they didnt really try to connect a producer and a consumer in an economic way right no one wants to pay for anything and so they all you know starting with google and facebook they went back to the playbook of you know the television companies back in the day no one wanted to pay for this signal they will pay for the tv box but not for the signal at least back in the day and so advertising kind of filled that gap and advertising was new and interesting and it somehow didnt take over our lives quite right fast forward google provides a service that people dont want to pay for and so somewhat surprisingly in the nineties they made they ended up making huge amounts so they cornered the advertising market it didnt seem like that was going to happen at least to me these little things on the right hand side of the screen just did not seem all that economically interesting but that companies had maybe no other choice the tv market was going away and billboards and so on so theyve they got it and i think that sadly that google just has it was doing so well with that at making such money they didnt think much more about how wait a minute is there a producer consumer relationship to be set up here not just between us and the advertisers market to be created is there an actual market between the producer consumer theyre the producers the person who created that video clip the person that made that website the person who could make more such things the person who could adjust it as a function of demand the person on the other side whos asking for different kinds of things you know so you see glimmers of that now theres influencers and theres kind of a little glimmering of a market but it should have been done 20 years ago it should have been thought about it should have been created in parallel with the advertising ecosystem and then facebook inherited that and i think they also didnt think very much about that so fast forward and now they are making huge amounts of money off of advertising and the news thing and all these clicks is just feeding the advertising its all connected up to the advertiser so you want more people to click on certain things because that money flows to you facebook youre very much incentivized to do that and when you start to find its breaking people are telling you well were getting into some troubles you try to adjust it with your smart ai algorithms right and figure out what are bad clicks so maybe it shouldnt be click through rate it should be something else i find that pretty much hopeless it does get into all the complexity of human life and you can try to fix it you should but you could also fix the whole business model and the business model is that really what are are there some human producers and consumers out there is there some economic value to be liberated by connecting them directly is it such that its so valuable that people will be able to pay for it all right and micro payments like small payments micro but even have to be micro so i like the example suppose im going next week im going to india never been to india before right i have a couple of days in mumbai i have no idea what to do there right and i could go on the web right now and search its going to be kind of hopeless im not going to find you know i have lots of advertisers in my face right what i really want to do is broadcast to the world that i am going to mumbai and have someone on the other side of a market look at me and and theres a recommendation system there so im not looking at all possible people coming to mumbai theyre looking at the people who are relevant to them so someone in my age group someone who kind of knows me in some level i give up a little privacy by that but im happy because what im going to get back is this person can make a little video for me or theyre going to write a little two page paper on heres the cool things that you want to do and move by this week especially right im going to look at that im not going to pay a micro payment im going to pay you know a hundred dollars or whatever for that its real value its like journalism um and as an honest subscription its that im going to pay that person in that moment companys going to take 5 of that and that person has now got it its a gig economy if you will but you know done for it you know thinking about a little bit behind youtube there was actually people who could make more of those things if they were connected to a market they would make more of those things independently you dont have to tell them what to do you dont have to incentivize them any other way um and so yeah these companies i dont think have thought long and hard about that so i do distinguish on facebook on the one side who just not thought about these things at all i think uh thinking that ai will fix everything uh and amazon thinks about them all the time because they were already out in the real world they were delivering packages peoples doors they were they were worried about a market they were worried about sellers and you know they worry and some things they do are great some things maybe not so great but you know theyre in that business model and then id say google sort of hovers somewhere in between i dont i dont think for a long long time they got it i think they probably see that youtube is more pregnant with possibility than than than they mightve thought and that theyre probably heading that direction um but uh you know silicon valley has been dominated by the google facebook kind of mentality and the subscription and advertising and that is thats the core problem right the fake news actually rides on top of that because it means that youre monetizing with clip through rate and that is the core problem you got to remove that so advertisement if were going to linger on that i mean thats an interesting thesis i dont know if everyone really deeply thinks about that so youre right the thought is the advertising model is the only thing we have the only thing well ever have we have to fix we have to build algorithms that despite that business model you know find the better angels of our nature and do good by society and by the individual but you think we can slowly you think first of all theres a difference between should and could so youre saying we should slowly move away from the advertising model and have a direct connection between the consumer and the creator the question i also have is can we because the advertising model is so successful now in terms of just making a huge amount of money and therefore being able to build a big company that provides has really smart people working that create a good service do you think its possible and just to clarify you think we should move away well i think we should yeah but we is the you know me so society yeah well the companies i mean so first of all full disclosure im doing a day a week at amazon because i kind of want to learn more about how they do things so you know im not speaking for amazon in any way but you know i did go there because i actually believe they get a little bit of this or trying to create these markets and they dont really use advertising is not a crucial part of it well thats a good question so it has become not crucial but its become more and more present if you go to amazon website and you know without revealing too many deep secrets about amazon i can tell you that you know a lot of people in the company question this and theres a huge questioning going on you do not want a world where theres zero advertising that actually is a bad world okay so heres a way to think about it youre a company that like amazon is trying to bring products to customers right and the customer at any given moment you want to buy a vacuum cleaner say you want to know whats available for me and you know its not going to be that obvious you have to do a little bit of work at it the recommendation system will sort of help right but now suppose this other person over here has just made the world you know they spent a huge amount of energy they had a great idea they made a great vacuum cleaner they know they really did it they nailed it its an mit you know whiz kid that made a great new vacuum cleaner right its not going to be in the recommendation system no one will know about it the algorithms will not find it and ai will not fix that okay at all right how do you allow that vacuum cleaner to start to get in front of people be sold well advertising and here what advertising is its a signal that youre you believe in your product enough that youre willing to pay some real money for it and to me as a consumer i look at that signal i say well first of all i know these are not just cheap little ads cause we have now right now there i know that you know these are super cheap you know pennies if i see an ad where its actually i know the company is only doing a few of these and theyre making you know real money is kind of flowing and i see an ad i may pay more attention to it and i actually might want that because i see hey that guy spent money on his vacuum cleaner maybe theres something good there so i will look at it and so thats part of the overall information flow in a good market so advertising has a role but the problem is of course that that signal is now completely gone because it just you know dominant by these tiny little things that add up to big money for the company you know so i think it will just i think it will change because the societies just dont you know stick with things that annoy a lot of people and advertising currently annoys people more than it provides information and i think that a google probably is smart enough to figure out that this is a dead this is a bad model even though its a hard huge amount of money and theyll have to figure out how to pull it away from it slowly and im sure the ceo there will figure it out but they need to do it and they needed it to so if you reduce advertising not to zero but you reduce it at the same time you bring up producer consumer actual real value being delivered so real money is being paid and they take a 5 cut that 5 could start to get big enough to cancel out the lost revenue from the kind of the poor kind of advertising and i think that a good company will do that will realize that and facebook you know again god bless them they bring you know grandmothers they bring childrens pictures into grandmothers lives its fantastic but they need to think of a new business model and thats the core problem there until they start to connect producer consumer i think they will just continue to make money and then buy the next social network company and then buy the next one and the innovation level will not be high and the health issues will not go away so i apologize that we kind of returned to words i dont think the exact terms matter but in sort of defense of advertisement dont you think the kind of direct connection between consumer and creator producer is what advertisement strives to do right so that is best advertisement is literally now facebook is listening to our conversation and heard that youre going to india and will be able to actually start automatically for you making these connections and start giving this offer so like i apologize if its just a matter of terms but just to draw a distinction is it possible to make advertisements just better and better and better algorithmically to where it actually becomes a connection almost a direct connection thats a good question so lets component on that first of all what we just talked about i was defending advertising okay so i was defending it as a way to get signals into a market that dont come any other way especially algorithmically its a sign that someone spent money on it its a sign they think its valuable and if i think that if other things someone else thinks its valuable and if i trust other people i might be willing to listen i dont trust that facebook though whos an intermediary between this i dont think they care about me okay i dont think they do and i find it creepy that they know im going to india next week because of our conversation why do you think that is so what could you just put your pr hat on why do you think you find facebook creepy and not trust them as do majority of the population so theyre out of the silicon valley companies i saw like not approval rate but theres ranking of how much people trust companies and facebook is in the gutter in the gutter including people inside of facebook so what do you attribute that to because when i come on you dont find it creepy that right now were talking that i might walk out on the street right now that some unknown person who i dont know kind of comes up to me and says i hear youre going to india i mean thats not even facebook thats just i want transparency in human society i want to have if you know something about me theres actually some reason you know something about me thats something that if i look at it later and audit it kind of i approve you know something about me because you care in some way theres a caring relationship even or an economic one or something not just that youre someone who could exploit it in ways i dont know about or care about or im troubled by or whatever were in a world right now where that happens way too much and that facebook knows things about a lot of people and could exploit it and does exploit it at times i think most people do find that creepy its not for them its not that facebook is not doing it because they care about them in a real sense and they shouldnt they should not be a big brother caring about us that is not the role of a company like that why not wait not the big brother part but the caring the trusting i mean dont those companies just to link on it because a lot of companies have a lot of information about us i would argue that theres companies like microsoft that has more information about us than facebook does and yet we trust microsoft more well microsoft is pivoting microsoft you know under satya nadella has decided this is really important we dont want to do creepy things really want people to trust us to actually only use information in ways that they really would approve of that we dont decide right and im just kind of adding that the health of a market is that when i connect to someone who produces a consumer its not just a random producer or consumer its people who see each other they dont like each other but they sense that if they transact some happiness will go up on both sides if a company helps me to do that in moments that i choose of my choosing then fine so and also think about the difference between you know browsing versus buying right there are moments in my life i just want to buy you know a gadget or something i need something for that moment i need some ammonia for my house or something because i got a problem with a spill i want to just go in i dont want to be advertised at that moment i dont want to be led down various you know thats annoying i want to just go and have it be extremely easy to do what i want other moments i might say no its like today im going to the shopping mall i want to walk around and see things and see people and be exposed to stuff so i want control over that though i dont want the companys algorithms to decide for me right i think thats the thing theres a total loss of control if facebook thinks they should take the control from us of deciding when we want to have certain kinds of information when we dont what information that is how much it relates to what they know about us that we didnt really want them to know about us i dont want them to be helping me in that way i dont want them to be helping them by they decide they have control over what i want and when i totally agree facebook by the way i have this optimistic thing where i think facebook has the kind of personal information about us that could create a beautiful thing so im really optimistic of what facebook could do its not what its doing but what it could do so i dont see that i think that optimism is misplaced because theres not a bit you have to have a business model behind these things create a beautiful thing is really lets be lets be clear its about something that people would value and i dont think they have that business model and i dont think they will suddenly discover it by what you know a long hot shower i disagree i disagree in terms of you can discover a lot of amazing things in a shower so i didnt say that i said they wont come they wont do it but in the shower i think a lot of other people will discover it i think that this guy so i should also full disclosure theres a company called united masters which im on their board and theyve created this music market and i have a hundred thousand artists now signed on and theyve done things like gone to the nba and the nba the music you find behind nba clips right now is their music right thats a company that had the right business model in mind from the get go right executed on that and from day one there was value brought to so here you have a kid who made some songs who suddenly their songs are on the nba website right thats real economic value to people and so you know so you and i differ on the optimism of being able to sort of change the direction of the titanic right so i yeah im older than you so ive seen some titanics crash got it but and just to elaborate cause i totally agree with you and i just want to know how difficult you think this problem is of so for example i want to read some news and i would theres a lot of times in the day where something makes me either smile or think in a way where i like consciously think this really gave me value like i sometimes listen to the daily podcasts in the new york times way better than the new york times themselves by the way for people listening thats like real journalism is happening for some reason in the podcast space it doesnt make sense to me but often i listen to it 20 minutes and i would be willing to pay for that like 5 10 for that experience and how difficult thats kind of what youre getting at is that little transaction how difficult is it to create a frictionless system like uber has for example for other things whats your intuition there so i first of all i pay little bits of money to you know to send theres something called courts that does financial things i like medium as a site i dont pay there but i would you had a great post on medium i would have loved to pay you a dollar and not others i wouldnt have wanted it per se because there should be also sites where thats not actually the goal the goal is to actually have a broadcast channel that i monetize in some other way if i chose to i mean i could now people know about it i could im not doing it but thats fine with me also the musicians who are making all this music i dont think the right model is that you pay a little subscription fee to them right because people can copy the bits too easily and its just not that somewhere the value is the value is that a connection was made between real human beings then you can follow up on that all right and create yet more value so no i think theres a lot of open questions here hot open questions but also yeah i do want good recommendation systems that recommend cool stuff to me but its pretty hard right i dont like them to recommend stuff just based on my browsing history i dont like the based on stuff they know about me quote unquote whats unknown about me is the most interesting so this is the this is the really interesting question we may disagree maybe not i think that i love recommender systems and i want to give them everything about me in a way that i trust yeah but you but you dont because so for example this morning i clicked on a you know i was pretty sleepy this morning i clicked on a story about the queen of england yes right i do not give a damn about the queen of england i really do not but it was clickbait it kind of looked funny and i had to say what the heck are they talking about i dont want to have my life you know heading that direction now thats in my browsing history the system in any reasonable system will think that i care about the queen of england thats browsing history right but but youre saying all the trace all the digital exhaust or whatever thats been kind of the models if you collect all this stuff youre going to figure all of us out well if youre trying to figure out like kind of one person like trump or something maybe you could figure him out but if youre trying to figure out you know 500 million people you know no way no way you think so no i do i think so i think we are humans are just amazingly rich and complicated every one of us has our little quirks every one of us has our little things that could intrigue us that we dont even know it will intrigue us and theres no sign of it in our past but by god there it comes and you know you fall in love with it and i dont want a company trying to figure that out for me and anticipate that i want them to provide a forum a market a place that i kind of go and by hook or by crook this happens you know i im walking down the street and i hear some chilean music being played and i never knew i liked chilean music but wow so there is that side and i want them to provide a limited but you know interesting place to go right and so dont try to use your ai to kind of you know figure me out and then put me in a world where you figured me out you know no create huge spaces for human beings where our creativity and our style will be enriched and come forward and itll be a lot of more transparency i wont have people randomly anonymously putting comments up and ill special based on stuff they know about me facts that you know we are so broken right now if youre you know especially if youre a celebrity but you know its about anybody that anonymous people are hurting lots and lots of people right now thats part of this thing that silicon valley is thinking that you know just collect all this information and use it in a great way so no im not im not a pessimist im very much an optimist by nature but i think thats just been the wrong path for the whole technology to take be more limited create let humans rise up dont try to replace them thats the ai mantra dont try to anticipate them dont try to predict them because youre youre youre not going to youre not going to be able to do those things youre going to make things worse okay so right now just give this a chance right now the recommender systems are the creepy people in the shadow watching your every move so theyre looking at traces of you theyre not directly interacting with you sort of the your close friends and family the way they know you is by having conversation by actually having interactions back and forth do you think theres a place for recommender systems sort of to step cause you you just emphasize the value of human to human connection but yeah just give it a chance ai human connection is there a role for an ai system to have conversations with you in terms of to try to figure out what kind of music you like not by just watching what you listening to but actually having a conversation natural language or otherwise yeah no im im so im not against it i just wanted to push back against the maybe youre saying you have options for facebook so there i think its misplaced but but i think that distributing yeah no so good for you go for it thats a hard spot to be in yeah no good human interaction like on our daily the context around me in my own home is something that i dont want some big company to know about at all but i would be more than happy to have technology help me with it which kind of technology well you know just alexa amazon well a good alexas done right and i think alexa is a research platform right now more than anything else but alexa done right you know could do things like i i leave the water running in my garden and i say hey alexa the waters running in my garden and even have alexa figure out that that means when my wife comes home that she should be told about that thats a little bit of a reasoning i would call that ai and by any kind of stretch its a little bit of reasoning and it actually kind of would make my life a little easier and better and you know i dont i wouldnt call this a wow moment but i kind of think that overall rises human happiness up to have that kind of thing but not when youre lonely alexa knowing loneliness no no i dont want alexa to be feel intrusive and i dont want just the designer of the system to kind of work all this out i really want to have a lot of control and i want transparency and control and if a company can stand up and give me that in the context of new technology i think theyre good first of all be way more successful than our current generation and like i said i was mentioning microsoft i really think theyre theyre pivoting to kind of be the trusted old uncle but you know i think that they get that this is a way to go that if you let people find technology empowers them to have more control and have and have control not just over privacy but over this rich set of interactions that that people are going to like that a lot more and thats thats the right business model going forward what does control over privacy look like do you think you should be able to just view all the data that no its much more than that i mean first of all it should be an individual decision some people dont want privacy they want their whole life out there other peoples want it privacy is not a zero one its not a legal thing its not just about which data is available which is not i like to recall to people that you know a couple hundred years ago everyone there was not really big cities everyone lived in on the countryside and villages and villages everybody knew everything about you very you didnt have any privacy is that bad are we better off now well you know arguably no because what did you get for that loss of certain kinds of privacy well people help each other if they because they know everything about you they know somethings bads happening they will help you with that right and now you live in a big city no one knows about that you get no help so it kind of depends the answer i want certain people who i trust and there should be relationships i should kind of manage all those but who knows what about me i should have some agency there it shouldnt i shouldnt be a drift in a sea of technology where i have no agency i dont want to go reading things and checking boxes so i dont know how to do that and im not a privacy researcher per se i just i recognize the vast complexity of this its not just technology its not just legal scholars meeting technologists theres gotta be kind of a whole layers around it and so i when i alluded to this emerging engineering field this is a big part of it when electrical engineering came im not one around at the time but you just didnt plug electricity into walls and all kinds of work you dont have to have like underwriters laboratory that reassured you that that plugs not going to burn up your house and that that machine will do this and that and everything therell be whole people who can install things therell be people who can watch the installers therell be a whole layers you know an onion of these kinds of things and for things as deep and interesting as privacy which is as least as interesting as electricity thats going to take decades to kind of work out but its going to require a lot of new structures that we dont have right now so its kind of hard to talk about it and youre saying theres a lot of money to be made if you get it right so something you should look at a lot of money to be made in all these things that provide human services and people recognize them as useful parts of their lives so yeah so yeah the dialogue sometimes goes from the exuberant technologists to the no technology is good kind of and thats you know in our public discourse you know and as far as you see too much of this kind of thing and the sober discussions in the middle which are the challenge he wants to have or where we need to be having our conversations and you know theres just not actually theres not many forum fora for those you know theres thats thats kind of what i would look for maybe i could go and i could read a comment section of something and it would actually be this kind of dialogue going back and forth you dont see much of this right which is why actually theres a resurgence of podcasts out of all because people are really hungry for conversation but theres technology is not helping much so comment sections of anything including youtube is not hurting and not helping\",\n          \"we are becoming cyborgs our brains are fundamentally changed everyone who grew up with electronics we are fundamentally different from previous from homo sapiens i call us homo techno i think we have evolved into homo techno which is like essentially a new species previous technologies i mean may have even been more profound and moved us to a certain degree but i think the computers are what make us homo techno i think this is what its a brain augmentation so it like allows for actual evolution like the computers accelerate the degree to which all the other technologies can also be accelerated would you classify yourself as a homo sapien or a homo techno definitely homo techno so youre one of the earliest of the species i think most of us are the following is a conversation with grimes an artist musician songwriter producer director and a fascinating human being who thinks a lot about both the history and the future of human civilization studying the dark periods of our past to help form an optimistic vision of our future this is the lex friedman podcast to support it please check out our sponsors in the description and now dear friends heres grimes oh yeah the cloud lifter there you go there you go you know your stuff have you ever used a cloud lifter yeah i actually this microphone cloud lifter is what michael jackson used so no really yeah this is like thriller and stuff this mic and a cloud lifter yeah its a incredible microphone its very flattering on vocals ive used this a lot its great for demo vocals its great in a room sometimes its easier to record vocals if youre just in a room and the musics playing and you just wanna feel it so its not in the headphones and this mic is pretty directional so i think its a good mic for just vibing out and just getting a real good vocal take just vibing just in a room anyway this is the michael jackson quincy jones microphone i feel way more badass now all right you wanna just get into it i guess so all right one of your names at least in this space and time is c like the letter c and you told me that c means a lot of things its the speed of light its the render rate of the universe its yes in spanish its the crescent moon and it happens to be my favorite programming language because it basically runs the world but its also powerful fast and its dangerous because you can mess things up really bad with it because of all the pointers but anyway which of these associations will the name c is the coolest to you i mean to me the coolest is the speed of light obviously or the speed of light when i say render rate of the universe i think i mean the speed of light because essentially thats what were rendering at see i think well know if were in a simulation if the speed of light changes because if they can improve their render speed then well its already pretty good its already pretty good but if it improves then well know we can probably be like okay theyve updated or upgraded well its fast enough for us humans because it seems immediate theres no delay theres no latency in terms of us humans on earth interacting with things but if youre like intergalactic species operating on a much larger scale then youre gonna start noticing some weird stuff or if you can operate in like around a black hole then youre gonna start to see some render issues you cant go faster than the speed of light correct so it really limits our ability or ones ability to travel space theoretically you can you have wormholes so theres nothing in general relativity that precludes faster than the speed of light travel but it just seems youre gonna have to do some really funky stuff with very heavy things that have like weirdnesses that have basically terrors in space time we dont know how to do that do navigators know how to do it do navigators yeah folding space basically making wormholes so the name c yes who are you do you think of yourself as multiple people are you one person do you know like in this morning were you a different person than you are tonight we are i should say recording this basically at midnight which is awesome yes thank you so much i think im about eight hours late no youre right on time good morning this is the beginning of a new day soon anyway are you the same person you were in the morning and the evening is there multiple people in there do you think of yourself as one person or maybe you have no clue or are you just a giant mystery to yourself okay these are really intense questions but lets go lets go because i asked this myself like look in the mirror who are you people tell you to just be yourself but what does that even mean i mean i think my personality changes with everyone i talk to so i have a very inconsistent personality yeah person to person so the interaction your personality materializes or my mood like ill go from being like a megalomaniac to being like you know just like a total hermit who is very shy so some combinatorial combination of your mood and the person youre interacting with yeah mood and people im interacting with but i think everyones like that maybe not well not everybody acknowledges it and able to introspect it who brings out what kind of person what kind of mood brings out the best in you as an artist and as a human can you introspect this like my best friends like people i can when im like super confident and i know that theyre gonna understand everything im saying so like my best friends then when i can start being really funny thats always my like peak mode but its like yeah takes a lot to get there lets talk about constraints youve talked about constraints and limits do those help you out as an artist or as a human being or do they get in the way do you like the constraints so in creating music in creating art in living life do you like the constraints that this world puts on you or do you hate them if constraints are moving then youre good right like its like as we are progressing with technology were changing the constraints of like artistic creation you know making video and music and stuff is getting a lot cheaper theres constantly new technology and new software thats making it faster and easier we have so much more freedom than we had in the 70s like when michael jackson you know when they recorded thriller with this microphone like they had to use a mixing desk and all this stuff and like probably even get in a studio its probably really expensive and you have to be a really good singer and you have to know how to use like the mixing desk and everything and now i can just you know make ive made a whole album on this computer i have a lot more freedom but then im also constrained in different ways because theres like literally millions more artists its like a much bigger playing field its just like i also i didnt learn music im not a natural musician so i dont know anything about actual music i just know about like the computer so im really kind of just like messing around and like trying things out well yeah i mean but the nature of music is changing so youre saying you dont know actual music what music is changing music is becoming youve talked about this is becoming its like merging with technology yes its becoming something more than just like the notes on a piano its becoming some weird composition that requires engineering skills programming skills some kind of human robot interaction skills and still some of the same things that michael jackson had which is like a good ear for a good sense of taste of whats good and not the final thing when its put together like youre allowed youre enabled empowered with a laptop to layer stuff to start like layering insane amounts of stuff and its super easy to do that i do think music production is a really underrated art form i feel like people really dont appreciate it when i look at publishing splits the way that people like pay producers and stuff its super producers are just deeply underrated like so many of the songs that are popular right now or for the last 20 years like part of the reason theyre popular is because the production is really interesting or really sick or really cool and its like i dont think listeners like people just dont really understand what music production is its not its sort of like this weird discombobulated art form its not like a formal because its so new there isnt like a formal training path for it its mostly driven by like autodidacts like its like almost everyone i know whos good at production like they didnt go to music school or anything they just taught themselves are theyre mostly different like the music producers you know is there some commonalities that time together or are they all just different kinds of weirdos cause i just i just hung out with rick rubin i dont know if youve yeah i mean rick rubin is like literally one of the gods of music production like hes one of the people who first you know who like made music production you know made the production as important as the actual lyrics or the notes but the thing he does which is interesting i dont know if you can speak to that but just hanging out with him he seems to just sit there in silence close his eyes and listen its like he almost does nothing and that nothing somehow gives you freedom to be the best version of yourself so thats music production somehow too which is like encouraging you to do less to simplify to like push towards minimalism i mean i guess i mean i work differently from rick rubin cause rick rubin produces for other artists whereas like i mostly produce for myself so its a very different situation i also think rick rubin hes in that i would say advanced category of producer where like youve like earned your you can have an engineer and stuff and people like do the stuff for you but i usually just like do stuff myself so youre the engineer the producer and the artist yeah i guess i would say im in the era like the post rick rubin era like i come from the kind of like skrillex school of thought which is like where you are yeah the engineer producer artist like where i mean lately sometimes ill work with a producer now im gently sort of delicately starting to collaborate a bit more but like i think im kind of from the like the whatever 2010s explosion of things where everything became available on the computer and you kind of got this like lone wizard energy thing going so you embraced being the loneliness is the loneliness somehow an engine of creativity like so most of your stuff most of your creative quote unquote genius in quotes is in the privacy of your mind yes well it was but heres the thing i was talking to daniel eck and he said hes like most artists they have about 10 years like 10 good years and then they usually stop making their like vital shit and i feel like im sort of like nearing the end of my 10 years on my own so you have to become somebody else now im like im in the process of becoming somebody else and reinventing when i work with other people because ive never worked with other people i find that i make like that im exceptionally rejuvenated and making like some of the most vital work ive ever made so because i think another human brain is like one of the best tools you can possibly find like its a funny way to put it i love it its like if a tool is like you know whatever hp plus one or like adds some like stats to your character like another human brain will like square it instead of just like adding something double up the experience points i love this we should also mention were playing tavern music before this and which i love which i first i think i first you had to stop the tavern music yeah because it doesnt the audio okay okay but it makes yeah itll make the podcast annoying add it in post add it in post no one will want to listen to the podcast they probably would but it makes me it reminds me like of a video game like a role playing video game where you have experience points theres something really joyful about wandering places like elder scrolls like skyrim just exploring these landscapes in another world and then you get experience points and you can work on different skills and somehow you progress in life i dont know its simple it doesnt have some of the messy complexities of life and theres usually a bad guy you can fight in skyrim its dragons and so on im sure in elden ring theres a bunch of monsters you can fight i love that i feel like elden ring i feel like this is a good analogy to music production though because its like i feel like the engineers and the people creating these open worlds are its sort of like similar to people to music producers where its like this hidden archetype that like no one really understands what they do and no one really knows who they are but theyre like its like the artist engineer because its like its both art and fairly complex engineering well youre saying they dont get enough credit arent you kind of changing that by becoming the person doing everything arent you isnt the engineer well i mean others have gone before me im not you know theres like timbaland and skrillex and theres all these people that are like you know very famous for this but i just think the general i think people get confused about what it is and just dont really know what it is per se and its just when i see a song like when theres like a hit song like im just trying to think of like just going for like even just a basic pop hit like whats it like rules by dua lipa or something the production on that is actually like really crazy i mean the song is also great but its like the production is exceptionally memorable like you know and its just like no one i cant i dont even know who produced that song its just like isnt part of like the rhetoric of how we just discuss the creation of art we just sort of like dont consider the music producer because i think the music producer used to be more just simply recording things yeah thats interesting because when you think about movies we talk about the actor and the actresses but we also talk about the directors we dont talk about like that with the music as often the beatles music producer was one of the first kind of guy one of the first people sort of introducing crazy sound design into pop music i forget his name he has the same i forget his name but you know like he was doing all the weird stuff like dropping pianos and like yeah oh to get the yeah yeah yeah to get the sound to get the authentic sound what about lyrics you think those where did they fit into how important they are i was heartbroken to learn that elvis didnt write his songs i was very mad a lot of people dont write their songs i understand this but but heres the thing i feel like theres this desire for authenticity i used to be like really mad when like people wouldnt write or produce their music and id be like thats fake and then i realized theres all this like weird bitterness and like agronus in art about authenticity but i had this kind of like weird realization recently where i started thinking that like art is sort of a decentralized collective thing like art is kind of a conversation with all the artists that have ever lived before you you know like its like youre really just sort of its not like anyones reinventing the wheel here like youre kind of just taking you know thousands of years of art and like running it through your own little algorithm and then like making your interpretation of it you just joined the conversation with all the other artists that came before its just a beautiful way to look at it like and its like i feel like everyones always like theres all this copyright and ip and this and that or authenticity and its just like i think we need to stop seeing this as this like egotistical thing of like oh the creative genius the lone creative genius or this or that because its like i think art shouldnt be about that i think art is something that sort of brings humanity together and its also art is also kind of the collective memory of humans its like we dont give a fuck about whatever ancient egypt like how much grain got sent that day and sending the records and like you know like who went where and you know how many shields needed to be produced for this like we just remember their art and its like you know its like in our day to day life theres all this stuff that seems more important than art because it helps us function and survive but when all this is gone like the only thing thats really gonna be left is the art the technology will be obsolete thats so fascinating like the humans will be dead that is true a good compression of human history is the art weve generated across the different centuries the different millennia so when the aliens come when the aliens come theyre gonna find the hieroglyphics and the pyramids i mean art could be broadly defined they might find like the engineering marvels the bridges the rockets the i guess i sort of classify though architecture is art too i consider engineering in those formats to be art for sure it sucks that like digital art is easier to delete so if theres an apocalypse a nuclear war that can disappear yes and the physical theres something still valuable about the physical manifestation of art that sucks that like music for example has to be played by somebody yeah i do think we should have a foundation type situation where we like you know how we have like seed banks up in the north and stuff like we should probably have like a solar powered or geothermal little bunker that like has all human knowledge you mentioned daniel ek and spotify what do you think about that as an artist whats spotify is that empowering to me spotify as a consumer is super exciting it makes it easy for me to access music from all kinds of artists get to explore all kinds of music make it super easy to sort of curate my own playlist and have fun with all that it was so liberating to let go you know i used to collect you know albums and cds and so on like horde albums yeah like they matter but the reality you could you know that was really liberating that i could let go of that and letting go of the albums youre kind of collecting allows you to find new music exploring new artists and all that kind of stuff but i know from a perspective of an artist that could be like you mentioned competition could be a kind of constraint because theres more and more and more artists on the platform i think its better that theres more artists i mean again this might be propaganda because this is all from a conversation with daniel ek so this could easily be propaganda were all a victim of somebodys propaganda so lets just accept this but daniel ek was telling me that you know to understand really difficult concepts just in a very different way like an emotional intelligence about something deep within oh yeah no like if x hurts like if x bites me really hard and im like ow like he gets hes sad hes like sad if he hurts me by accident yeah which hes huge so he hurts me a lot by accident yeah thats so interesting that that mind emerges and he and children dont really have memory of that time so we cant even have a conversation with them about it yeah i just thank god they dont have a memory of this time because like think about like i mean with our youngest baby like its like im like have you read the sci fi short story i have no mouth but i must scream good title no oh man i mean you should read that i have no mouth but i must scream i hate getting into this roccos basilisk shit its kind of a story about the about like an ai thats like torturing someone in eternity and they have like no body the way they describe it it sort of sounds like what it feels like like being a baby like youre conscious and youre just getting inputs from everywhere and you have no muscles and youre like jelly and you like cant move and you try to like communicate but you cant communicate and were and like youre just like in this like hell state i think its good we cant remember that like my little baby is just exiting that like shes starting to like get muscles and have more like autonomy but like watching her go through the opening phase i was like i was like this does not seem good oh you think its kind of like like i think it sucks i think it might be really violent like violent mentally violent psychologically violent consciousness emerging i think is a very violent thing i never thought about that i think its possible that we all carry quite a bit of trauma from it that we dont i think that would be a good thing to study because i think if i think addressing that trauma like i think that might be oh you mean like echoes of it are still there in the shadows somewhere i think its gotta be i feel this this help the helplessness the like existential and that like fear of being in like an unknown place bombarded with inputs and being completely helpless like thats gotta be somewhere deep in your brain and that cant be good for you what do you think consciousness is this whole conversation has impossibly difficult questions what do you think it is debbie said this is like so hard yeah we talked about music for like two minutes all right no im so im just over music im over music yeah i still like it it has its purpose no i love music i mean musics the greatest thing ever its my favorite thing but i just like every interview is like what is your process like i dont know im just done i cant do anything i do want to ask you about able to live oh ill tell you about ableton because abletons sick no one has ever asked about ableton though yeah well because i just need tech support mainly i can help you i can help you with your ableton tech anyway from ableton back to consciousness what do you do you think this is a thing that only humans are capable of can robots be conscious can like when you think about entities you think theres aliens out there that are conscious like is conscious what is consciousness theres this terrence mckenna quote that ive found that i fucking love am i allowed to swear on here yes nature loves courage you make the commitment and nature will respond to that commitment by removing impossible obstacles dream the impossible dream and the world will not grind you under it will lift you up this is the trick this is what all these teachers and philosophers who really counted who really touched the alchemical gold this is what they understood this is the shamanic dance in the waterfall this is how magic is done by hurling yourself into the abyss and discovering its a feather bed yeah and for this reason i do think there are no technological limits i think like what is already happening here this is like impossible this is insane and weve done this in a very limited amount of time and were accelerating the rate at which were doing this so i think digital consciousness its inevitable and we may not be able to even understand what that means but i like hurling yourself into the abyss so were surrounded by all this mystery and we just keep hurling ourselves into it like fearlessly and keep discovering cool shit yeah like i just think its like like who even knows if the laws of physics the laws of physics are probably just the current like as i was saying speed of light is the current render rate its like if were in a simulation theyll be able to upgrade that like i sort of suspect when we made the james webb telescope like part of the reason we made that is because we had an upgrade you know and so now more of space has been rendered so we can see more of it now yeah but i think humans are super super super limited cognitively so i wonder if well be allowed to create more intelligent beings that can see more of the universe as their render rate is upgraded maybe were cognitively limited everyone keeps talking about how were cognitively limited and ai is gonna render us obsolete but its like you know like this is not the same thing as like an amoeba becoming an alligator like its like if we create ai again thats intelligent design thats literally all religions are based on gods that create consciousness like we are god making like what we are doing is incredibly profound and like even if we cant compute even if were so much worse than them like just like unfathomably worse than like you know an omnipotent kind of ai its like we i do not think that they would just think that we are stupid i think that they would recognize the profundity of what we have accomplished are we the gods or are they the gods in our personality i mean were kind of the guy its complicated its complicated like were but they would acknowledge the value well i hope they acknowledge the value of paying respect to the creative ancestors i think they would think its cool i think if curiosity is a trait that we can quantify and put into ai then i think if ai are curious then they will be curious about us and they will not be hateful or dismissive of us they might you know see us as i dont know its like im not like oh fuck these dogs lets just kill all the dogs i love dogs dogs have great utility dogs like provide a lot of we make friends with them we have a deep connection with them we anthropomorphize them like we have a real love for dogs for cats and so on for some reason even though theyre intellectually much less than us and i think there is something sacred about us because its like if you look at the universe like the whole universe is like cold and dead and sort of robotic and its like you know ai intelligence you know its kind of more like the universe its like cold and you know logical and you know abiding by the laws of physics and whatever but like were this like loosey goosey weird art thing that happened and i think its beautiful and like i think even if we i think one of the values if consciousness is a thing that is most worth preserving which i think is the case i think consciousness i think if theres any kind of like religious or spiritual thing it should be that consciousness is sacred like then you know i still think even if ai render us obsolete and we climate change its too bad and we get hit by a comet and we dont become a multi planetary species fast enough but like ai is able to populate the universe like i imagine like if i was an ai i would find more planets that are capable of hosting biological life forms and like recreate them because were fun to watch yeah were fun to watch yeah but i do believe that ai can have some of the same magic of consciousness within it because consciousness we dont know what it is so you know theres some kind of or it might be a different magic it might be like a strange a strange different right because theyre not gonna have hormones like i feel like a lot of our magic is hormonal kind of i dont know i think some of our magic is the limitations the constraints and within that the hormones and all that kind of stuff the finiteness of life and then we get given our limitations we get to come up with creative solutions of how to dance around those limitations we partner up like penguins against the cold we fall in love and then love is ultimately some kind of allows us to delude ourselves that were not mortal and finite and that life is not ultimately you live alone youre born alone you die alone and then love is like for a moment or for a long time forgetting that and so we come up with all these creative hacks that make life like fascinatingly fun yeah yeah yeah fun yeah and then ai might have different kinds of fun yes and hopefully our funs intersect once in a while i think there would be a little intersection of the fun yeah yeah what do you think is the role of love in the human condition i think why is it useful is it useful like a hack or is this like fundamental to what it means to be human the capacity to love i mean i think love is the evolutionary mechanism that is like beginning the intelligent design like i was just reading about do you know about kropotkin hes like an anarchist like old russian anarchist i live next door to michael malice i dont know if you know who that is hes an anarchist hes a modern day anarchist okay anarchists are fun im kind of getting into anarchism a little bit this is probably not a good route to be taking but oh no i think if youre listen you should expose yourself to ideas theres no harm to thinking about ideas i think anarchists challenge systems in interesting ways and they think in interesting ways its just as good for the soul its like refreshes your mental palette i dont think we should actually i wouldnt actually ascribe to it but ive never actually gone deep on anarchy as a philosophy so im doing you should still think about it though when you read when you listen because im reading about the russian revolution a lot and there was the soviets and lenin and all that but then there was kropotkin and his anarchist sect and they were sort of interesting because he was kind of a technocrat actually he was like women can be more equal if we have appliances he was really into using technology to reduce the amount of work people had to do but so kropotkin was a biologist or something he studied animals and he was really at the time like i think its nature magazine i think it mightve even started as a russian magazine but he was publishing studies everyone was really into darwinism at the time and survival of the fittest and war is the mechanism by which we become better and it was this real cementing this idea in society that violence kill the weak and thats how we become better and then kropotkin was kind of interesting because he was looking at instances he was finding all these instances in nature where animals were like helping each other and stuff and he was like actually love is a survival mechanism like theres so many instances in the animal kingdom where like cooperation and like helping weaker creatures and all this stuff is actually an evolutionary mechanism i mean you even look at child rearing like child rearing is like immense amounts of just love and goodwill and just like theres no immediate youre not getting any immediate feedback of like winning its not competitive its literally its like we actually use love as an evolutionary mechanism just as much as we use war and i think weve like missing the other part and weve reoriented weve culturally reoriented like science and philosophy has oriented itself around darwinism a little bit too much and the kropotkin model i think is equally valid like its like cooperation and love and stuff is just as essential for species survival and evolution it should be a more powerful survival mechanism in the context of evolution and it comes back to like we think engineering is so much more important than motherhood but its like if you lose the motherhood the engineering means nothing we have no more humans its like i think our society should the survival of the the way we see we conceptualize evolution should really change to also include this idea i guess yeah theres some weird thing that seems irrational that is also core to what it means to be human so love is one such thing they could make you do a lot of irrational things but that depth of connection and that loyalty is a powerful thing are they irrational or are they rational like its like is you know maybe losing out on some things in order to like keep your family together or in order like its like what are our actual values well right i mean the rational thing is if you have a cold economist perspective you know motherhood or sacrificing your career for love you know in terms of salary in terms of economic wellbeing in terms of flourishing of you as a human being that could be seen on some kind of metrics as a irrational decision suboptimal decision but theres the manifestation of love could be the optimal thing to do theres a kind of saying save one life save the world thats the thing that doctors often face which is like well its considered irrational because the profit model doesnt include social good yes yeah so if a profit model includes social good then suddenly these would be rational decisions might be difficult to you know it requires a shift in our thinking about profit and might be difficult to measure social good yes but were learning to measure a lot of things yeah digitizing a lot of things where were actually you know quantifying vision and stuff like were like you know like you go on facebook and they can like facebook can pretty much predict our behaviors like were a surprising amount of things that seem like mysterious consciousness soul things have been quantified at this point so surely we can quantify these other things yeah but as more and more of us are moving the digital space i wanted to ask you about something from a fan perspective i kind of you know you as a musician you as an online personality it seems like you have all these identities and you play with them one of the cool things about the internet it seems like you can play with identities so as we move into the digital world more and more maybe even in the so called metaverse i mean i love the metaverse and i love the idea but like the way this has all played out didnt go well and people are mad about it and i think we need to like i think thats temporary i think its temporary just like you know how all the celebrities got together and sang the song imagine by jeff leonard and everyone started hating the song imagine im hoping thats temporary because its a damn good song so i think its just temporary like once you actually have virtual worlds whatever theyre called metaverse or otherwise it becomes i dont know well we do have virtual worlds like video games elden ring have you played elden ring you havent played elden ring im really afraid of playing that game literally amazed it looks way too fun it looks i would wanna go there and stay there forever its yeah so fun its so nice oh man yeah so thats the yeah thats a metaverse thats a metaverse but youre not really how immersive is it in the sense that does the three dimension like virtual reality integration necessary can we really just take our close our eyes and kind of plug in in the 2d screen and become that other being for time and really enjoy that journey that we take and we almost become that youre no longer c im no longer lex youre that creature whatever the hell it is in that game yeah that is that i mean thats why i love those video games i really do become those people for a time but like it seems like with the idea of the metaverse the idea of the digital space well even on twitter you get a chance to be somebody for prolonged periods of time like across a lifespan you know you have a twitter account for years for decades and youre that person i dont know if thats a good thing i feel very tormented by it by twitter specifically by social media representation of you i feel like the public perception of me has gotten so distorted that i find it kind of disturbing its one of the things thats disincentivizing me from like wanting to keep making art because im just like ive completely lost control of the narrative and the narrative is some of it is my own stupidity but a lot like some of it has just been like hijacked by forces far beyond my control i kind of got in over my head in things like im just a random indian musician but i just got like dragged into geopolitical matters and like financial like the stock market and shit and so its just like its just there are very powerful people who have at various points in time had very vested interest in making me seem insane and i cant fucking fight that and i just like people really want their celebrity figures to like be consistent and stay the same and like people have a lot of like emotional investment in certain things and like first of all like im like artificially more famous than i should be isnt everybody whos famous artificially famous no but like i should be like a weird niche indie thing and i make pretty challenging i do challenging weird fucking shit a lot and i accidentally by proxy got like foisted into sort of like weird celebrity culture but like i cannot be media trained they have put me through so many hours of media training i would love to see bf fly in that wall i cant do like when i do i try so hard and i like learn this thing and i like got it and im like i got it i got it i got it but i just cant stop saying like my mouth just says things like and its just like and i just do i just do things i just do crazy things like im i just i need to do crazy things and its just i should not be its too jarring for people and the contradictory stuff and then all the by association like you know its like im in a very weird position and my public image the avatar of me is now this totally crazy thing that is so lost from my control so you feel the burden of the avatar having to be static so the avatar on twitter or the avatar on instagram on these social platforms is as a burden it becomes like cause like people dont want to accept a changing avatar a chaotic avatar avatar is a stupid shit sometimes they think the avatar is morally wrong or they think the avatar and maybe it has been and like i question it all the time like im like like i dont know if everyones right and im wrong i dont know like but you know a lot of times people ascribe intentions to things the worst possible intentions at this point people think im you know but which is fine all kinds of words yes yes and its fine im not complaining about it but im just its a curiosity to me that we live these double triple quadruple lives and i have this other life that is like more people know my other life than my real life which is interesting probably i mean you too i guess probably yeah but i have the luxury so we have all different you know like i dont know what im doing there is an avatar and youre mediating who you are through that avatar i have the nice luxury not the luxury maybe by intention of not trying really hard to make sure theres no difference between the avatar and the private person do you wear a suit all the time yeah you do wear a suit not all the time recently because i get recognized a lot i have to not wear the suit to hide im such an introvert im such a social anxiety and all that kind of stuff so i have to hide away i love wearing a suit because it makes me feel like im taking the moment seriously like im i dont know it makes me feel like a weirdo in the best possible way suits feel great every time i wear a suit im like i dont know why im not doing this more fashion in general if youre doing it for yourself i dont know its a really awesome thing but yeah i think there is definitely a painful way to use social media and an empowering way and i dont know if any of us know which is which so were trying to figure that out some people i think doja cat is incredible at it incredible like just masterful i dont know if you like follow that so okay so not taking anything seriously joking absurd humor that kind of thing i think doja cat might be like the greatest living comedian right now like im more entertained by doja cat than actual comedians like shes really fucking funny on the internet shes just great at social media its just you know yeah the nature of humor like humor on social media is also a beautiful thing the absurdity the absurdity and memes like i just wanna like take a moment i love like when were talking about art and credit and authenticity i love that theres this i mean now memes are like theyre no longer like memes arent like new but its still this emergent art form that is completely egoless and anonymous and we just dont know who made any of it and its like the forefront of comedy and its just totally anonymous and it just feels really beautiful it just feels like this beautiful collective human art project thats like this like decentralized comedy thing that just makes memes add so much to my day and many peoples days and its just like i dont know i dont think people ever i dont think we stop enough and just appreciate how sick it is that memes exist because also making a whole brand new art form in like the modern era thats like didnt exist before like i mean they sort of existed but the way that they exist now as like this like you know like me and my friends like we joke that we go like mining for memes or farming for memes like a video game and like meme dealers and like whatever like its you know its this whole memes are this whole like new comedic language well its this art form the interesting thing about it is that lame people seem to not be good at memes like corporate cant infiltrate memes yeah they really cant they try they could try but its like its weird cause like they try so hard and every once in a while im like fine like you got a good one i think ive seen like one or two good ones but like yeah they really cant cause theyre even corporate is infiltrating web three its making me really sad but they cant infiltrate the memes and i think theres something really beautiful about that that gives power thats why dogecoin is powerful its like all right im gonna f you to sort of anybody whos trying to centralize is trying to control the rich people that are trying to roll in and control this control the narrative wow i hadnt thought about that but how would you fix twitter how would you fix social media for your own like youre an optimist youre a positive person theres a bit of a cynicism that you have currently about this particular little slice of humanity i tend to think twitter could be beautiful im not that cynical about it im not that cynical about it i actually refuse to be a cynic on principle yes i was just briefly expressing some personal pathos personal stuff it was just some personal pathos but like like just to vent a little bit just to speak i dont have cancer i love my family i have a good life that is if that is my biggest one of my biggest problems then its a good life yeah you know that was a brief although i do think there are a lot of issues with twitter just in terms of like the public mental health but due to my proximity to the current dramas i honestly feel that i should not have opinions about this because i think that if elon ends up getting twitter that is a being the arbiter of truth or public discussion that is a responsibility i do not i am not qualified to be responsible for that and i do not want to say something that might like dismantle democracy and so i just like actually i actually think i should not have opinions about this because i truly am not i dont want to have the wrong opinion about this and i think im too close to the actual situation wherein i should not have i have thoughts in my brain but i think i am scared by my proximity to this situation isnt that crazy that a few words that you could say could change world affairs and hurt people i mean thats the nature of celebrity at a certain point that you have to be you have to a little bit a little bit not so much that it destroys you or puts too much constraints but you have to a little bit think about the impact of your words i mean we as humans you talk to somebody at a bar you have to think about the impact of your words like you can say positive things you can say negative things you can affect the direction of one life but on social media your words can affect the direction of many lives thats crazy its a crazy world to live in its worthwhile to consider that responsibility take it seriously sometimes just like you did choose kind of silence choose sort of respectful like i do have a lot of thoughts on the matter im just i dont if my thoughts are wrong this is one situation where the stakes are high you mentioned a while back that you were in a cult thats centered around bureaucracy so you cant really do anything because it involves a lot of paperwork and i really love a cult thats just like kafkaesque yes just like i mean it was like a joke but it was i know but i love this idea the holy rain empire yeah it was just like a kafkaesque pro bureaucracy cult but i feel like thats what human civilization is is that because when you said that i was like oh that is kind of what humanity is is this bureaucracy cult i do yeah i have this theory i really think that we really bureaucracy is starting to kill us and i think like we need to reorient laws and stuff like i think we just need sunset clauses on everything like i think the rate of change in culture is happening so fast and the rate of change in technology and everything is happening so fast its like when you see these hearings about like social media and cambridge analytica and everyone talking its like even from that point so much technological change has happened from like those hearings and its just like were trying to make all these laws now about ai and stuff i feel like we should be updating things like every five years and like one of the big issues in our society right now is were just getting bogged down by laws and its making it very hard to change things and develop things in austin i dont wanna speak on this too much but like one of my friends is working on a housing bill in austin to try to like prevent like a san francisco situation from happening here because obviously were getting a little mini san francisco here like housing prices are skyrocketing its causing massive gentrification this is really bad for anyone whos not super rich like theres so much bureaucracy part of the reason this is happening is because you need all these permits to build it takes like years to get permits to like build anything its so hard to build and so theres very limited housing and theres a massive influx of people and its just like you know this is a microcosm of like problems that are happening all over the world where its just like were dealing with laws that are like 10 20 30 40 100 200 years old and they are no longer relevant and its just slowing everything down and causing massive social pain yeah but its like its also makes me sad when i see politicians talk about technology and when they dont really get it but most importantly they lack curiosity and like that like inspired excitement about like how stuff works and all that stuff theyre just like they see they have a very cynical view of technology its like tech companies are just trying to do evil on the world from their perspective and they have no curiosity about like how recommender systems work or how ai systems work natural language processing how robotics works how computer vision works you know they always take the most cynical possible interpretation of what technology would be used and we should definitely be concerned about that but if youre constantly worried about that and youre regulating based on that youre just going to slow down all the innovation i do think a huge priority right now is undoing the bad energy surrounding the emergence of silicon valley like i think that like a lot of things were very irresponsible during that time and you know like even just this current whole thing with twitter and everything its like there has been a lot of negative outcomes from the sort of technocracy boom but one of the things thats happening is that like its alienating people from wanting to care about technology and i actually think technology is probably some of the better probably the best i think we can fix a lot of our problems more easily with technology than with you know fighting the powers that be as a you know not to go back to the star wars quote or the buckminster fuller quote lets go to some dark questions if we may for time what is the darkest place youve ever gone in your mind is there a time a period of time a moment that you remember that was difficult for you i mean when i was 18 my best friend died of a heroin overdose and it was like my and then shortly after that one of my other best friends committed suicide and that sort of like coming into adulthood dealing with two of the most important people in my life dying in extremely disturbing violent ways was a lot that was a lot do you miss them yeah definitely miss them did that make you think about your own life about the finiteness of your own life the places your mind can go did you ever in the distance far away contemplate just your own death or maybe even taking your own life oh never oh no im so i love my life i cannot fathom suicide im so scared of death i havent im too scared of death my manager my managers like the most zen guy my managers always like you need to accept death you need to accept death and im like look i can do your meditation i can do the meditation but i cannot accept death i like i will fight im terrified of death i will like fight although i actually think death is important i recently went to this meeting about immortality and in the process of thats the actual topic of the meeting im sorry no no it was this girl it was a bunch of people working on like anti aging stuff it was like some like seminary thing about it and i went in really excited i was like yeah like okay like what do you got like how can i live for 500 years or a thousand years and then like over the course of the meeting like it was sort of like right it was like two or three days after the russian invasion started and i was like man like what if putin was immortal like what if im like man maybe immortality is not good i mean like if you get into the later dune stuff the immortals cause a lot of problem cause as we were talking about earlier with the music and like brains calcify like good people could become immortal but bad people could become immortal but i also think even the best people power corrupts and power alienates you from like the common human experience and right so the people that get more and more powerful even the best people who like whose brains are amazing like i think death might be important i think death is part of you know like i think with ai one thing we might want to consider i dont know when i talk about ai im such not an expert and probably everyone has all these ideas and theyre already figured out but when i was talking nobody is an expert in anything see okay go ahead but when i you were talking about yeah but i like its just like i think some kind of pruning but its a tricky thing because if theres too much of a focus on youth culture then you dont have the wisdom so i feel like were in a tricky were in a tricky moment right now in society where its like weve really perfected living for a long time so theres all these really like old people who are like really voting against the wellbeing of the young people you know and like its like there shouldnt be all this student dead and we need like healthcare like universal healthcare and like just voting against like best interests but then you have all these young people that dont have the wisdom that are like yeah we need communism and stuff and its just like like literally i got canceled at one point for i ironically used a stalin quote in my high school yearbook but it was actually like a diss against my high school i saw that yeah and people were like you used to be a stalinist and now youre a class traitor and its like its like oh man just like please google stalin please google stalin like you know ignoring the lessons of history yes and its like were in this really weird middle ground where its like we are not finding the happy medium between wisdom and fresh ideas and theyre fighting each other and its like like really like what we need is like the fresh ideas and the wisdom to be like collaborating and its like what the fighting in a way is the searching for the happy medium and in a way maybe we are finding the happy medium maybe thats what the happy medium looks like and for ai systems there has to be its you know you have the reinforcement learning you have the dance between exploration and exploitation sort of doing crazy stuff to see if theres something better than what you think is the optimal and then doing the optimal thing and dancing back and forth from that you would stuart russell i dont know if you know that is ai guy with thinks about sort of how to control super intelligent ai systems and his idea is that we should inject uncertainty and sort of humility into ai systems that they never as they get wiser and wiser and wiser and more intelligent theyre never really sure they always doubt themselves and in some sense when you think of young people thats a mechanism for doubt its like its how society doubts whether the thing it has converged towards is the right answer so the voices of the young people is a society asking itself a question the way ive been doing stuff for the past 50 years maybe its the wrong way and so you can have all of that within one ai system i also think though that we need to i mean actually thats actually really interesting and really cool but i also think theres a fine balance of i think we maybe also overvalue the idea that the old systems are always bad and i think there are things that we are perfecting and we might be accidentally overthrowing things that we actually have gotten to a good point just because we value disruption so much and we value fighting against the generations before us so much that theres also an aspect of sometimes were taking two steps forward one step back because okay maybe we kind of did solve this thing and now were like fucking it up you know and so i think theres like a middle ground there too yeah were in search of that happy medium let me ask you a bunch of crazy questions okay all right you can answer in a short way or in a long way whats the scariest thing youve ever done these questions are gonna be ridiculous something tiny or something big something big skydiving or touring your first record going on this podcast ive had two crazy brushes like really scary brushes with death where i randomly got away on scay i dont know if i should talk about those on here well i dont know i think i might be the luckiest person alive though like this might be too dark for a podcast though i feel like i dont know if this is like good content for a podcast i dont know what is good content it might hijack heres a safer one i mean having a baby really scared me before just the birth process surgery like just having a baby is really scary so just like the medical aspect of it not the responsibility were you ready for the responsibility did you were you ready to be a mother all the beautiful things that comes with motherhood that you were talking about all the changes and all that were you ready for that or did you feel ready for that no i think it took about nine months to start getting ready for it and im still getting more ready for it because now you keep realizing more things as they start getting as the consciousness grows and stuff you didnt notice with the first one now that youve seen the first one older youre noticing it more like the sort of like existential horror of coming into consciousness with baby y or baby sailor mars or whatever she has like so many names at this point that its we really need to probably settle on one if you could be someone else for a day someone alive today but somebody you havent met yet who would you be would i be modeling their brain state or would i just be in their body you can choose the degree to which youre modeling their brain state cause you can still take a third person perspective and realize you have to realize that youre can they be alive or can it be dead no oh they would be brought back to life right if theyre dead yeah you can bring people back definitely hitler or stalin i wanna understand evil you would need to oh to experience what it feels like i wanna be in their brain feeling what they feel i might change you forever returning from that yes but i think it would also help me understand how to prevent it and fix it that might be one of those things once you experience it itll be a burden to know it cause you wont be able to transfer that yeah but a lot of things are burdens but its a useful burden but its a useful burden yeah that for sure i wanna understand evil and psychopathy and that i have all these fake twitter accounts where i go into different algorithmic bubbles to try to understand ill keep getting in fights with people and realize were not actually fighting i think we used to exist in a monoculture before social media and stuff we kinda all got fed the same thing so we were all speaking the same cultural language but i think recently one of the things that we arent diagnosing properly enough with social media is that theres different dialects theres so many different dialects of chinese there are now becoming different dialects of english i am realizing there are people who are saying the exact same things but theyre using completely different verbiage and were punishing each other for not using the correct verbiage and were completely misunderstanding people are just misunderstanding what the other people are saying and i just got in a fight with a friend about anarchism and communism and shit for two hours and then by the end of a conversation and then shed say something and im like but thats literally what im saying and she was like what and then i was like fuck weve different im like our english the way we are understanding terminology is like drastically like our algorithm bubbles are creating mini dialects of how language is interpreted how language is used thats so fascinating and so were like having these arguments that we do not need to be having and theres polarization thats happening that doesnt need to be happening because weve got these like algorithmically created dialects occurring plus on top of that theres also different parts of the world that speak different languages so theres literally lost in translation kind of communication i happen to know the russian language and just know how different it is then the english language and i just wonder how much is lost in a little bit of man i actually cause i have a question for you i have a song coming out tomorrow with i speak who are a russian band and i speak a little bit of russian and i was looking at the title and the title in english doesnt match the title in russian im curious about this cause look it says the title in english is last day and then the title in russian is new day my pronunciation sucks new day like what like a new day a new day yeah new day new day like its two different meanings yeah new day yeah yeah yeah new day new day but last day new day so last day would be the last day yeah maybe they or maybe the title includes both the russian and its for maybe maybe its for bilingual but to be honest novodin sounds better than just musically like novodin is new day thats the current one and posledniy den is the last day i think novodin i dont like novodin but the meaning is so different thats kind of awesome actually though theres an explicit sort of contrast like that if everyone on earth disappeared and it was just you left what would your day look like like what would you do everybodys dead as far as you are there corpses there well seriously its a big let me think through this its a big difference if theres just like birds singing versus if theres like corpses littering the street yeah theres corpses everywhere im sorry its and you dont actually know what happened and you dont know why you survived and you dont even know if theres others out there but it seems clear that its all gone what would you do what would i do listen im somebody who really enjoys the moment enjoys life i would just go on like enjoying the inanimate objects i would just look for food basic survival but most of it is just listen when i just i take walks and i look outside and im just happy that we get to exist on this planet to be able to breathe air its just all beautiful its full of colors all of this kind of stuff just theres so many things about life your own life conscious life thats fucking awesome so i would just enjoy that but also maybe after a few weeks the engineer would start coming out like wanna build some things maybe theres always hope searching for another human maybe probably searching for another human probably trying to get to a tv or radio station and broadcast something thats interesting i didnt think about that so like really maximize your ability to connect with others yeah like probably try to find another person would you be excited to see to meet another person or terrified because you know id be excited no matter what yeah yeah yeah yeah being alone for the last however long of my life would be really bad thats the one instance i might i dont think id kill myself but i might kill myself if i had to so you love people you love connection to other humans yeah i kinda hate people too but yeah thats a love hate relationship yeah i feel like wed have a bunch of weird nietzsche questions and stuff though oh yeah like i wonder cause im like when podcast im like is this interesting for people to just have like or i dont know maybe people do like this when i listen to podcasts im into like the lore like the hard lore like i just love like dan carlin im like give me the facts just like like the facts into my bloodstream but you also dont know like youre a fascinating mind to explore so you dont realize as youre talking about stuff the stuff youve taken for granted is actually unique and fascinating the way you think not always what like the way you reason through things is the fascinating thing to listen to because people kind of see oh theres other humans that think differently that explore thoughts differently thats the cool thats also cool so yeah dan carlin retelling of history by the way his retelling of history is very i think whats exciting is not the history is his way of thinking about history no i think dan carlin is one of the people like when dan carlin is one of the people that really started getting me excited about like revolutionizing education because like dan carlin instilled i already like really liked history but he instilled like an obsessive love of history in me to the point where like now im fucking reading like going to bed reading like part four of the rise and fall of the third reich or whatever like i got like dense ass history but like he like opened that door that like made me want to be a scholar of that topic like its like i feel like hes such a good teacher he just like you know and it sort of made me feel like one of the things we could do with education is like find like the worlds great the teachers that like create passion for the topic because autodidactricism i dont know how to say that properly but like self teaching is like much faster than being lectured to like its much more efficient to sort of like be able to teach yourself and then ask a teacher questions when you dont know whats up but like you know thats why its like in university and stuff like you can learn so much more material so much faster because youre doing a lot of the learning on your own and youre going to the teachers for when you get stuck but like these teachers that can inspire passion for a topic i think that is one of the most invaluable skills in our whole species like because if you can do that then you its like ai like ai is going to teach itself so much more efficiently than we can teach it we just needed to get it to the point where it can teach itself and then it finds the motivation to do so right yeah so like you inspire it to do so yeah and then it could teach itself what do you make of the fact you mentioned rise and fall of the third reich i just have you read that yeah i read it twice you read it twice yes okay so no one even knows what it is yeah and im like wait i thought this was like a super poppin book super pop yeah im not like that im not that far in it but it is its so interesting yeah its written by a person that was there which is very important to kind of you know you start being like how could this possibly happen and then when you read rise and fall of the third reich its like people tried really hard for this to not happen people tried they almost reinstated a monarchy at one point to try to stop this from happening like they almost like abandoned democracy to try to get this to not happen at least the way it makes me feel is that theres a bunch of small moments on which history can turn yes its like small meetings yes human interactions and its both terrifying and inspiring because its like even just attempts at assassinating hitler like time and time again failed and they were so close was it like operation valkyrie such a good and then theres also the role of thats a really heavy burden which is from a geopolitical perspective the role of leaders to see evil before it truly becomes evil to anticipate it to stand up to evil because evil is actually pretty rare in this world at a scale that hitler was we tend to you know in the modern discourse kind of call people evil too quickly if you look at ancient history like there was a ton of hitlers i actually think its more the norm than like again going back to like my sort of intelligent design theory i think one of the things weve been successfully doing in our slow move from survival of the fittest to intelligent design is weve kind of been eradicating like if you look at like ancient assyria and stuff like that shit was like brutal and just like the heads on the like brutal like genghis khan just like genocide after genocide was like throwing plague bodies over the walls and decimating whole cities or like the muslim conquests of like damascus and shit just like people cities used to get leveled all the fucking time okay get into the bronze age collapse its basically there was like almost like roman level like society like there was like all over the world like global trade like everything was awesome through a mix of i think a bit of climate change and then the development of iron because basically bronze could only come from this the way to make bronze like everything had to be funneled through this one iranian mine and so its like there was just this one supply chain and this is one of the things that makes me worried about supply chains and why i think we need to be so thoughtful about i think our biggest issue with society right now like the thing that is most likely to go wrong is probably supply chain collapse because war climate change whatever like anything that causes supply chain collapse our population is too big to handle that and like the thing that seems to cause dark ages is mass supply chain collapse but the bronze age collapse happened like it was sort of like this ancient collapse that happened where like literally like ancient egypt all these cities everything just got like decimated destroyed abandoned cities like hundreds of them there was like a flourishing society like we were almost coming to modernity and everything got leveled and they had this mini dark ages but it was just like theres so little writing or recording from that time that like there isnt a lot of information about the bronze age collapse but it was basically equivalent to like medieval the medieval dark ages but it just happened i dont know the years but like thousands of years earlier and then we sort of like recovered from the bronze age collapse empire reemerged writing and trade and everything reemerged and then we of course had the more contemporary dark ages and then over time weve designed mechanism to lessen and lessen the capability for the destructive power centers to emerge theres more recording about the more contemporary dark ages so i think we have like a better understanding of how to avoid it but i still think were at high risk for it i think thats one of the big risks right now so the natural state of being for humans is for there to be a lot of hitlers which has gotten really good at making it hard for them to emerge weve gotten better at collaboration and resisting the power like authoritarians to come to power were trying to go country by country like were moving past this were kind of like slowly incrementally like moving towards like not scary old school war stuff and i think seeing it happen in some of the countries that at least nominally are like supposed to have moved past that thats scary because it reminds us that it can happen like in the places that have moved supposedly as hopefully moved past that and possibly at a civilization level like you said supply chain collapse might make people resource constraint might make people desperate angry hateful violent and drag us right back in i mean supply chain collapse is how like the ultimate thing that caused the middle ages was supply chain collapse its like people because people were reliant on a certain level of technology like people like you look at like britain like they had glass like people had aqueducts people had like indoor heating and cooling and like running water and like buy food from all over the world and trade and markets like people didnt know how to hunt and forage and gather and so were in a similar situation we are not educated enough to survive without technology so if we have a supply chain collapse that like limits our access to technology there will be like massive starvation and violence and displacement and war like you know its like yeah in my opinion its like the primary marker of like what a dark age is well technology is kind of enabling us to be more resilient in terms of supply chain in terms of to all the different catastrophic events that happened to us although the pandemic has kind of challenged our preparedness for the catastrophic what do you think is the coolest invention humans come up with the wheel fire cooking meat computers computers freaking computers internet or computers which one what do you think the previous technologies i mean may have even been more profound and moved us to a certain degree but i think the computers are what make us homo tech now i think this is what its a brain augmentation and so it like allows for actual evolution like the computers accelerate the degree to which all the other technologies can also be accelerated would you classify yourself as a homo sapien or a homo techno definitely homo techno so youre one of the earliest of the species i think most of us are like as i said like i think if you like looked at brain scans of us versus humans a hundred years ago it would look very different i think we are physiologically different just even the interaction with the devices has changed our brains well and if you look at a lot of studies are coming out to show that like theres a degree of inherited memory so some of these physiological changes in theory should be we should be passing them on so like thats you know thats not like a an instance of physiological change thats gonna fizzle out in theory that should progress like to our offspring speaking of offspring what advice would you give to a young person like in high school whether there be an artist a creative an engineer any kind of career path or maybe just life in general how they can live a life they can be proud of i think one of my big thoughts and like especially now having kids is that i dont think we spend enough time teaching creativity and i think creativity is a muscle like other things and theres a lot of emphasis on you know learn how to play the piano and then you can write a song or like learn the technical stuff and then you can do a thing but i think its like i have a friend whos like worlds greatest guitar player like you know amazing sort of like producer works with other people but hes really sort of like you know he like engineers and records things and like does solos but he doesnt really like make his own music and i was talking to him and i was like dude youre so talented at music like why dont you make music or whatever and he was like cause i got im too old i never learned the creative muscle and its like you know its embarrassing its like learning the creative muscle takes a lot of failure and it also sort of if when youre being creative you know youre throwing paint at a wall and a lot of stuff will fail so like part of it is like a tolerance for failure and humiliation and thats somehow thats easier to develop when youre young or be persist through it when youre young everything is easier to develop when youre young yes and the younger the better it could destroy you i mean thats the shitty thing about creativity if you know failure could destroy you if youre not careful but thats a risk worth taking but also but at a young age developing a tolerance to failure is good i fail all the time like i do stupid shit all the time like in public in private i get canceled for ive make all kinds of mistakes but i just like am very resilient about making mistakes and so then like i do a lot of things that like other people wouldnt do and like i think my greatest asset is my creativity and i like i think pain like tolerance to failure is just a super essential thing that should be taught before other things brilliant advice yeah yeah i wish everybody encouraged sort of failure more as opposed to kind of cause we like punish failure were like no like when we were teaching kids were like no thats wrong like thats you know like x keeps like will be like wrong at the because i you know when i met him i came in all furious about spotify and like i grilled him super hard so ive got his answers here but he was saying like at the sort of peak of the cd industry there was like 20000 artists making millions and millions of dollars like there was just like a very tiny kind of 1 and spotify has kind of democratized the industry because now i think he said theres about a million artists making a good living from spotify and when i heard that i was like honestly i would rather make less money and have just like a decent living and have more artists be able to have that even though i like i wish it could include everyone but yeah thats really hard to argue with youtube is the same its youtubes mission they want to basically have as many creators as possible and make a living some kind of living and thats so hard to argue with its so hard but i think theres better ways to do it my manager i actually wish he was here like i would have brought him up my manager is building an app that can manage you so itll like help you organize your percentages and get your publishing and dah dah dah dah dah so you can take out all the middlemen so you can have a much bigger itll just like automate it so you can get so automate the manager automate management publishing and legal it can read the app hes building can read your contract and like tell you about it because one of the issues with music right now its not that were not getting paid enough but its that the art industry is filled with middlemen because artists are not good at business and from the beginning like frank sinatra its all mob stuff like its the music industry is run by business people not the artists and the artists really get very small cuts of like what they make and so i think part of the reason im a technocrat which i mean your fans are gonna be technocrats so no ones theyre not gonna be mad at me about this but like my fans hate it when i say this kind of thing or the general public they dont like technocrats they dont like technocrats like when i watched battle angel alita and they were like the martian technocracy and i was like yeah martian technocracy and then they were like and theyre evil and i was like oh okay i was like cause martian technocracy sounds sick to me yeah so your intuition as technocrats would create some kind of beautiful world for example what my managers working on if you can create an app that removes the need for a lawyer and then you could have smart contracts on the blockchain removes the need for like management and organizing all this stuff like can read your stuff and explain it to you can collect your royalties you know like then the small amounts the amount of money that youre getting from spotify actually means a lot more and goes a lot farther it can remove some of the bureaucracy some of the inefficiencies that make life not as great as it could be yeah i think the issue isnt that theres not enough like the issue is that theres inefficiency and im really into this positive sum mindset you know the win win mindset of like instead of you know fighting over the scraps how do we make the or worrying about scarcity like instead of a scarcity mindset why dont we just increase the efficiency and you know in that way expand the size of the pie let me ask you about experimentation so you said which is beautiful being a musician is like having a conversation with all those that came before you how much of creating music is like kind of having that conversation trying to fit into the cultural trends and how much of it is like trying to as much as possible be an outsider and come up with something totally new its like when youre thinking when youre experimenting are you trying to be totally different totally weird are you trying to fit in man this is so hard because i feel like im kind of in the process of semi retiring from music so this is like my old brain yeah bring it from like the shelf put it on the table for a couple minutes well just poke it i think its a bit of both because i think forcing yourself to engage with new music is really great for neuroplasticity like i think you know as people part of the reason music is marketed at young people is because young people are very neuroplastic so like if youre 16 to like 23 or whatever its gonna be really easy for you to love new music and if youre older than that it gets harder and harder and harder and i think one of the beautiful things about being a musician is i just constantly force myself to listen to new music and i think it keeps my brain really plastic and i think this is a really good exercise i just think everyone should do this you listen to new music and you hate it i think you should just keep force yourself to like okay well why do people like it and like you know make your brain form new neural pathways and be more open to change thats really brilliant actually sorry to interrupt but like that exercise is really amazing to sort of embrace change embrace sort of practice neuroplasticity because like thats one of the things you fall in love with a certain band and you just kind of stay with that for the rest of your life and then you never understand the modern music thats a really good exercise most of the streaming on spotify is like classic rock and stuff like new music makes up a very small chunk of what is played on spotify and i think this is like not a good sign for us as a species i think yeah so its a good measure of the species open mindedness to change is how often you listen to new music the brain lets put the music brain back on the shelf i gotta pull out the futurist brain for a second in what wild ways do you think the future say in like 30 years maybe 50 years maybe a hundred years will be different from our current way of life on earth we can talk about augmented reality virtual reality maybe robots maybe space travel maybe video games maybe genetic engineering i can keep going cyborgs aliens world wars maybe destructive nuclear wars good and bad when you think about the future what are you imagining whats the weirdest and the wildest it could be have you read surface detail by iain banks surface detail is my favorite depiction of a oh wow you have to read this book its literally the greatest science fiction book possibly ever written iain banks is the man yeah for sure what have you read just the player of games i read that titles cant be copyrighted so you can just steal them and i was like player of games sick nice yeah so you can name your album like i always wanted to romeo and juliet or something i always wanted to name an album war and peace nice like that would be like you that is a good thats a good where have i heard that before you can do that like you could do that also things that are in the public domain for people who have no clue you do have a song called player of games yes oh yeah so iain banks surface detail is in my opinion the best future that ive ever read about or heard about in science fiction basically theres the relationship with super intelligence like artificial super intelligence is just its like great i want to credit the person who coined this term because i love this term and i feel like young women dont get enough credit in yeah so if you go to protopia futures on instagram what is her name personalized donor experience at scale our ai power donor experience monica bealskite im saying that wrong and im probably gonna im probably butchering this a bit but protopia is sort of if utopia is unattainable protopia is sort of like you know wow thats an awesome instagram protopia futures a great a future that is you know as good as we can get the future positive future ai is this a centralized ai in surface detail or is it distributed what kind of ai is it they mostly exist as giant super ships like sort of like the guild ships in dune like theyre these giant ships that kind of move people around and the ships are sentient and they can talk to all the passengers and i mean theres a lot of different types of ai in the banksyan future but in the opening scene of surface detail theres this place called the culture and the culture is basically a protopian future and a protopian future i think is like a future that is like obviously its not utopia its not perfect and like cause like striving for utopia i think feels hopeless and its sort of like maybe not the best terminology to be using so its like its a pretty good place like mostly like you know super intelligence and biological beings exist fairly in harmony theres not too much war theres like as close to equality as you can get you know its like approximately a good future like theres really awesome stuff its and in the opening scene this girl shes born as a sex slave outside of the culture so shes in a society that doesnt adhere to the cultural values she tries to kill the guy who is her like master but he kills her but unbeknownst to her when she was traveling on a ship through the culture like hell say like crazy things like x keeps being like like bubble car bubble car and im like and you know im like whats a bubble car like but like it doesnt like but i dont want to be like no youre wrong im like youre thinking of weird crazy shit like i dont know what a bubble car is but like its creating worlds and they might be internally consistent and through that you might discover something fundamental about this world yeah or hell like rewrite songs like with words that he prefers so like instead of baby shark he says baby car its like maybe hes onto something let me ask the big ridiculous question we were kind of dancing around it but what do you think is the meaning of this whole thing we have here of human civilization of life on earth but in general just life whats the meaning of life c have you did you read nova scene yet by james lovelock youre doing a lot of really good book recommendations here i havent even finished this so im a huge fraud yet again but like really early in the book he says this amazing thing like i feel like everyones so sad and cynical like everyones like the fermi paradox and everyone i just keep hearing people being like fuck what if were alone like oh no ah like ah ah and im like okay but like wait what if this is the beginning like in nova scene he says this is not gonna be a correct i cant like memorize quotes but he says something like what if our consciousness like right now like this is the universe waking up like what if instead of discovering the universe this is the universe like this is the evolution of the literal universe herself like we are not separate from the universe like this is the universe waking up this is the universe seeing herself for the first time like this is the universe becoming conscious the first time we were a part of that yeah cause its like we arent separate from the universe like this could be like an incredibly sacred moment and maybe like social media and all this things the stuff where were all getting connected together like maybe these are the neurons connecting of the like collective super intelligence that is waking up the yeah like you know its like maybe instead of something cynical or maybe if theres something to discover like maybe this is just you know were a blast assist of like some incredible kind of consciousness or being and just like in the first three years of life or for human children well forget about all the suffering that were going through now i think well probably forget about this i mean probably you know artificial intelligence will eventually render us obsolete i dont think theyll do it in a malicious way but i think probably we are very weak the sun is expanding like i dont know like hopefully we can get to mars but like were pretty vulnerable and i you know like i think we can coexist for a long time with ai and we can also probably make ourselves less vulnerable but you know i just think consciousness sentience self awareness like i think this might be the single greatest like moment in evolution ever and like maybe this is you know the big like the true beginning of life and were just were the blue green algae or were like the single celled organisms of something amazing the universe awakens and this is it yeah well see youre an incredible person youre a fascinating mind you should definitely do your friend liv mentioned that you guys were thinking of maybe talking i would love it if you explored your mind in this kind of media more and more by doing a podcast with her or just in any kind of way so youre an awesome person its an honor to know you its an honor to get to sit down with you late at night which is like surreal and i really enjoyed it thank you for talking today yeah no i mean huge honor i feel very underqualified to be here but im a big fan ive been listening to the podcast a lot and yeah me and liv would appreciate any advice and help and were definitely gonna do that so yeah anytime thank you cool thank you thanks for listening to this conversation with grimes to support this podcast please check out our sponsors in the description and now let me leave you with some words from oscar wilde yes im a dreamer for a dreamer is one who can only find her way by moonlight and her punishment is that she sees the dawn before the rest of the world thank you for listening and hope to see you next time with him one day a ship put a neural lace in her head and neural lace is sort of like its basically a neuralink because life imitates art it does indeed it does indeed so she wakes up and the opening scene is her memory has been uploaded by this neural lace when she has been killed and now she gets to choose a new body and this ai is interfacing with her recorded memory in her neural lace and helping her and being like hello youre dead but because you had a neural lace your memorys uploaded do you want to choose a new body and youre going to be born here in the culture and like start a new life which is just thats like the opening its like so sick and the ship is the super intelligence all the ships are kind of super intelligence but they still want to preserve a kind of rich fulfilling experience for the humans yeah like theyre like friends with the humans and then theres a bunch of ships that dont want to exist with biological beings but they just have their own place like way over there but they dont they just do their own thing theyre not necessarily so its a pretty this protopian existence is pretty peaceful yeah i mean and then for example one of the main fights in the book is theyre fighting theres these artificial hells that and people dont think its ethical to have artificial hell like basically when people do crime they get sent like when they die their memory gets sent to an artificial hell and theyre eternally tortured and so and then the way that society is deciding whether or not to have the artificial hell is that theyre having these simulated theyre having like a simulated war so instead of actual blood you know people are basically essentially fighting in a video game to choose the outcome of this but theyre still experiencing the suffering in this artificial hell or no can you experience stuff or so the artificial hell sucks and a lot of people in the culture want to get rid of the artificial hell theres a simulated wars are they happening in the artificial hell so no the simulated wars are happening outside of the artificial hell between the political factions who are so this political faction says we should have simulated hell to deter crime and this political faction is saying no simulated hell is unethical and so instead of like having you know blowing each other up with nukes theyre having like a giant fortnite battle to decide this which you know to me thats protopia thats like okay we can have war without death you know i dont think there should be simulated hells i think that is definitely one of the ways in which technology could go very very very very wrong so almost punishing people in a digital space or something like that yeah like torturing peoples memories so either as a deterrent like if you committed a crime but also just for personal pleasure if theres some sick demented humans in this world dan carlin actually has this episode of hardcore history on painful attainment oh that episode is fucked its dark because he kind of goes through human history and says like we as humans seem to enjoy secretly enjoy or used to be openly enjoy sort of the torture and the death watching the death and torture of other humans i do think if people were consenting we should be allowed to have gladiatorial matches but consent is hard to achieve in those situations it always starts getting slippery like it could be also forced consent like it starts getting weird theres way too much excitement like this is what he highlights theres something about human nature that wants to see that violence and its really dark and you hope that we can sort of overcome that aspect of human nature but thats still within us somewhere well i think thats what were doing right now i have this theory that what is very important about the current moment is that all of evolution has been survival of the fittest up until now and at some point the lines are kind of fuzzy but in the recent past or maybe even just right now were getting to this point where we can choose intelligent design like we probably since like the integration of the iphone like we are becoming cyborgs like our brains are fundamentally changed everyone who grew up with electronics we are fundamentally different from previous from homo sapiens i call us homo techno i think we have evolved into homo techno which is like essentially a new species like if you look at the way if you took an mri of my brain and you took an mri of like a medieval brain i think it would be very different the way that it has evolved do you think when historians look back at this time theyll see like this was a fundamental shift to what a human being is i think i do not think we are still homo sapiens i believe we are homo techno and i think we have evolved and i think right now the way we are evolving we can choose how we do that and i think we are being very reckless about how were doing that like were just having social media but i think this idea that like this is a time to choose intelligent design should be taken very seriously it like now is the moment to reprogram the human computer its like if you go blind your visual cortex will get taken over with other functions we can choose our own evolution we can change the way our brains work and so we actually have a huge responsibility to do that and i think im not sure who should be responsible for that but theres definitely not adequate education were being inundated with all this technology that is fundamentally changing the physical structure of our brains and we are not adequately responding to that to choose how we wanna evolve and we could evolve we could be really whatever we want and i think this is a really important time and i think if we choose correctly and we choose wisely consciousness could exist for a very long time and integration with ai could be extremely positive and i dont think enough people are focusing on this specific situation do you think we might irreversibly screw things up if we get things wrong now because the flip side of that it seems humans are pretty adaptive so maybe the way we figure things out is by screwing it up like social media over a generation well see the negative effects of social media and then we build new social medias and we just keep improving stuff and then we learn from the failures of the past because humans seem to be really adaptive on the flip side we can get it wrong in a way where literally we create weapons of war or increase hate past a certain threshold we really do a lot of damage i mean i think were optimized to notice the negative things but i would actually say one of the things that i think people arent noticing is if you look at silicon valley and you look at the technocracy like whats been happening there when silicon valley started it was all just facebook and all this for profit crap that really wasnt particular i guess it was useful but its sort of just whatever but now you see lab grown meat compostable or biodegradable single use cutlery or meditation apps i think we are actually evolving and changing and technology is changing i think there just maybe there isnt quite enough education about this and also i dont know if theres quite enough incentive for it because i think the way capitalism works what we define as profit were also working on an old model of what we define as profit i really think if we changed the idea of profit to include social good you can have economic profit social good also counting as profit would incentivize things that are more useful and more whatever spiritual technology or positive technology or things that help reprogram a human computer in a good way or things that help us intelligently design our new brains yeah theres no reason why within the framework of capitalism the word profit or the idea of profit cant also incorporate the well being of a human being so like long term well being long term happiness or even for example we were talking about motherhood like part of the reason im so late is because i had to get the baby to bed and its like i keep thinking about motherhood how under capitalism its like this extremely essential job that is very difficult that is not compensated and we sort of like value things by how much we compensate them and so we really devalue motherhood in our society and pretty much all societies like capitalism does not recognize motherhood its just a job that youre supposed to do for free and its like but i feel like producing great humans should be seen as a great as profit under capitalism like that should be thats like a huge social good like every awesome human that gets made adds so much to the world so like if that was integrated into the profit structure then you know and if we potentially found a way to compensate motherhood so come up with a compensation thats much broader than just money or or it could just be money like what if you just made i dont know but i dont know how youd pay for that like i mean thats where you start getting into reallocation of resources that people get upset over well like what if we made like a motherhood dow yeah yeah and you know used it to fund like single mothers like you know pay for making babies so i mean if you create and put beautiful things onto the world that could be companies that can be bridges that could be art that could be a lot of things and that could be children which are or education or anything that should be valued by society and that should be somehow incorporated into the framework of what as a market of what like if you contribute children to this world that should be valued and respected and sort of celebrated like proportional to what it is which is its the thing that fuels human civilization yeah like i its kind of important i feel like everyones always saying i mean i think were in very different social spheres but everyones always saying like dismantle capitalism and im like well okay well i dont think the government should own everything like i dont think we should not have private ownership like thats scary you know like that starts getting into weird stuff and just sort of like i feel theres almost no way to do that without a police state you know but obviously capitalism has some major flaws and i think actually mac showed me this idea called social capitalism which is a form of capitalism that just like considers social good to be also profit like you know its like right now companies need to like youre supposed to grow every quarter or whatever to like show that youre functioning well but its like okay well what if you kept the same amount of profit youre still in the green but then you have also all this social good like do you really need all this extra economic growth or could you add this social good and that counts and you know i dont know if i am not an economist i have no idea how this could be achieved but i dont think economists know how anything could be achieved either but they pretend its the thing they construct a model and they go on tv shows and sound like an expert thats the definition of economist how did being a mother becoming a mother change you as a human being would you say man i think it kind of changed everything and its still changing me a lot its actually changing me more right now in this moment than it was before like today like this just like in the most recent months and stuff can you elucidate that how change like when you wake up in the morning and you look at yourself its again which who are you how have you become different would you say i think its just really reorienting my priorities and at first i was really fighting against that because i somehow felt it was like a failure of feminism or something like i felt like it was like bad if like my kids started mattering more than my work and then like more recently i started sort of analyzing that thought in myself and being like thats also kind of a construct its like weve just devalued motherhood so much in our culture that like i feel guilty for caring about my kids more than i care about my work so feminism includes breaking out of whatever the construct is so just continually breaking its like freedom empower you to be free and that means but it also but like being a mother like im so much more creative like i cannot believe the massive amount of brain growth that i am why do you think that is just cause like the stakes are higher somehow i think its like its just so trippy watching consciousness emerge its just like its like going on a crazy journey or something its like the craziest science fiction novel you could ever read its just so crazy watching consciousness come into being and then at the same time like youre forced to value your time so much like when i have creative time now its so sacred i need to like be really fricking on it but the other thing is that i used to just be like a cynic and i used to just wanna like my last album was called miss anthropocene and it was like this like it was like a study in villainy or like it was like well what if we have instead of the old gods we have like new gods and its like miss anthropocene is like misanthrope like and anthropocene which is like the you know like and shes the goddess of climate change or whatever and shes like destroying the world and it was just like it was like dark and it was like a study in villainy and it was sort of just like like i used to like have no problem just making cynical angry scary art and not that theres anything wrong with that but i think having kids just makes you such an optimist it just inherently makes you wanna be an optimist so bad that like i feel more responsibility to make more optimistic things and i get a lot of shit for it because everyones like oh youre so privileged stop talking about like pie in the sky stupid concepts and focus on like the now but its like i think if we dont ideate about futures that could be good we wont be able to get them if everything is blade runner then were gonna end up with blade runner its like as we said earlier life imitates art like life really does imitate art and so we really need more protopian or utopian art i think this is incredibly essential for the future of humanity and i think the current discourse where thats seen as a thinking about protopia or utopia is seen as a dismissal of the problems that we currently have i think that is an incorrect mindset and like having kids just makes me wanna imagine amazing futures that like maybe i wont be able to build but they will be able to build if they want to yeah it does seem like ideation is a precursor to creation so you have to imagine it in order to be able to build it and there is a sad thing about human nature that somehow a cynical view of the world is seen as a insightful view you know cynicism is often confused for insight which is sad to see and optimism is confused for naivete yes yes like you dont youre blinded by your maybe your privilege or whatever youre blinded by something but youre certainly blinded thats sad thats sad to see because it seems like the optimists are the ones that create our future theyre the ones that build in order to build the crazy thing you have to be optimistic you have to be either stupid or excited or passionate or mad enough to actually believe that it can be built and those are the people that built it my favorite quote of all time is from star wars episode 8 which i know everyone hates do you like star wars episode 8 no yeah probably i would say i would probably hate it yeah i dont have strong feelings about it let me backtrack i dont have strong feelings about star wars im a tolkien person im more into dragons and orcs and ogres yeah i mean tolkien forever i really want to have one more son and call him i thought tao tecno tolkien would be cool its a lot of ts i like it yeah and well and tao is six two eight two pi yeah tao tecno yeah yeah yeah and then techno is obviously the best genre of music but also like technocracy it just sounds really good yeah thats right and techno tolkien tao tecno tolkien thats a good thats it tao tecno tolkien but star wars episode 8 i know a lot of people have issues with it personally on the record i think its the best star wars film youre starting trouble today yeah but dont kill what you hate save what you love dont kill what you hate dont kill what you hate save what you love and i think were in society right now were in a diagnosis mode were just diagnosing and diagnosing and diagnosing and were trying to kill what we hate and were not trying to save what we love enough and theres this buckminster fuller quote which im gonna butcher because i dont remember it correctly but its something along the lines of dont try to destroy the old bad models render them obsolete with better models maybe we dont need to destroy the oil industry maybe we just create a great new battery technology and sustainable transport and just make it economically unreasonable to still continue to rely on fossil fuels its like dont kill what you hate save what you love make new things and just render the old things unusable its like if the college debt is so bad and universities are so expensive and i feel like education is becoming obsolete i feel like we could completely revolutionize education and we could make it free and its like you look at jstor and you have to pay to get all the studies and everything what if we created a dao that bought jstor or we created a dao that was funding studies and those studies were open source or free for everyone and what if we just open sourced education and decentralized education and made it free and all research was on the internet and all the outcomes of studies were on the internet and no one has student debt and you just take tests when you apply for a job and if youre qualified then you can work there this is just like i dont know how anything works im just randomly ranting but i like the humility you gotta think from just basic first principles what is the problem whats broken what are some ideas thats it and get excited about those ideas and share your excitement and dont tear each other down its just when you kill things you often end up killing yourself like war is not a one sided like youre not gonna go in and just kill them like youre gonna get stabbed its like and i think when i talk about this nexus point of that were in this point in society where were switching to intelligent design i think part of our switch to intelligent design is that we need to choose nonviolence and we need to like i think we can choose to start i dont think we can eradicate violence from our species because i think we need it a little bit but i think we can choose to really reorient our primitive brains that are fighting over scarcity and that are so attack oriented and move into we can optimize for creativity and building yeah its interesting to think how that happens so some of it is just education some of it is living life and introspecting your own mind and trying to live up to the better angels of your nature for each one of us all those kinds of things at scale thats how we can sort of start to minimize the amount of destructive war in our world and thats to me probably youre the same technology is a really promising way to do that like social media should be a really promising way to do that its a way we connect i you know for the most part i really enjoy social media i just know all the negative stuff i dont engage with any of the negative stuff just not even like by blocking or any of that kind of stuff but just not letting it enter my mind like just like when somebody says something negative i see it i immediately think positive thoughts about them and i just forget they exist after that just move on because like that negative energy if i return the negative energy theyre going to get excited in a negative way right back and its just this kind of vicious cycle but you would think technology would assist us in this process of letting go of not taking things personally of not engaging in the negativity but unfortunately social media profits from the negativity so the current models i mean social media is like a gun like you should take a course before you use it like its like this is what i mean like when i say reprogram the human computer like in school you should learn about how social media optimizes to you know raise your cortisol levels and make you angry and crazy and stressed and like you should learn how to have hygiene about how you use social media but so you can yeah choose not to focus on the negative stuff but i dont know im not sure social media should i guess it should exist im not sure i mean were in the messy its the experimental phase like were working it out yeah its the early days i dont even know when you say social media i dont know what that even means were in the very early days i think social media is just basic human connection in the digital realm and that i think it should exist but theres so many ways to do it in a bad way theres so many ways to do it in a good way theres all discussions of all the same human rights we talk about freedom of speech we talk about sort of violence in the space of digital media we talk about hate speech we talk about all these things that we had to figure out back in the day in the physical space were now figuring out in the digital space and its like baby stages when the printing press came out it was like pure chaos for a minute you know its like when you inject when theres a massive information injection into the general population theres just gonna be i feel like the printing press i dont have the years but it was like printing press came out shit got really fucking bad for a minute but then we got the enlightenment and so its like i think were in this is like the second coming of the printing press were probably gonna have some shitty times for a minute and then were gonna have recalibrate to have a better understanding of how we consume media and how we deliver media speaking of programming the human computer you mentioned baby x so theres this young consciousness coming to be came from a cell like that whole thing doesnt even make sense it came from dna yeah and then theres this baby computer that just like grows and grows and grows and grows and now theres a conscious being with extremely impressive cognitive capabilities with have you met him yes yeah yeah hes actually really smart hes really smart yeah hes weird yeah or a baby he does i dont i havent i dont know a lot of other babies but he seems to be smart zach i dont hang out with babies often but this baby was very impressive he does a lot of pranks and stuff oh so hes like like hell like give you a treat and then take it away and laugh and like stuff like that so hes like a chess player so heres a cognitive sort of theres a computer being programmed so hes taking in the environment interacting with a specific set of humans how would you first of all what is it what let me ask i want to ask how do you program this computer and also how do you make sense of that theres a conscious being right there that wasnt there before its giving me a lot of crisis thoughts im thinking really hard i think thats part of the reason its like im struggling to focus on art and stuff right now cause baby x is becoming conscious and like my its just reorienting my brain like my brain is suddenly totally shifting of like oh shit like the way we raise children like i hate all the baby books and everything i hate them like theyre oh the art is so bad and like all this stuff everything about all the aesthetics and like im just like ah like this is so the programming languages were using to program these baby computers isnt good yeah like im thinking and i not that i have like good answers or know what to do but im just thinking really really hard about it i we recently watched totoro with him studio ghibli and its just like a fantastic film and he like responded to i know youre not supposed to show baby screens too much but like i think its the most sort of like i feel like its the highest art baby content like it really speaks theres almost no talking in it its really simple although all the dialogue is super super super simple you know and its like a one to three year old can like really connect with it like it feels like its almost aimed at like a one to three year old but its like great art and its so imaginative and its so beautiful and like the first time i showed it to him he was just like so invested in it unlike ive ever unlike anything else id ever shown him like he was just like crying when they cry and laughing when they laugh like just like having this roller coaster of like emotions like and he learned a bunch of words like he was and he started saying totoro and started just saying all this stuff after watching totoro and he wants to watch it all the time and i was like man why isnt there an industry of this like why arent our best artists focusing on making art like for the birth of consciousness like and thats one of the things ive been thinking i really wanna start doing you know i dont wanna speak before i do things too much but like im just like ages one to three like we should be putting so much effort into that and the other thing about totoro is its like its like better for the environment because adults love totoro its such good art that everyone loves it like i still have all my old totoro merch from when i was a kid like i literally have the most ragged old totoro merch like everybody loves it everybody keeps it its like why does the art we have for babies need to suck and be not accessible to adults and then just be thrown out when you know they age out of it like its like i dont know i dont have like a fully formed thought here but this is just something ive been thinking about a lot is like how do we like how do we have more totoroesque content like how do we have more content like this that like is universal and everybody loves but is like really geared to an emerging consciousness emerging consciousness in the first like three years of life that so much turmoil so much evolution of mind is happening it seems like a crucial time would you say to make it not suck do you think of basically treating a child like they have the capacity to have the brilliance of an adult or even beyond that is that how you think of that mind or no cause they still they like it when you talk weird and stuff like they respond better to cause even they can imitate better when your voice is higher like people say like oh dont do baby talk but its like when your voice is higher its closer to something they can imitate so they like like the baby talk actually kind of works like it helps them learn to communicate ive found it to be more effective with learning words and stuff but like youre not speaking down to them like do they have the capacity\",\n          \"the following is a conversation with sean carroll hes a theoretical physicist at caltech specializing in quantum mechanics gravity and cosmology hes the author of several popular books one on the arrow of time called from eternity to here one on the higgs boson called particle at the end of the universe and one on science and philosophy called the big picture on the origins of life meaning and the universe itself he has an upcoming book on quantum mechanics that you can preorder now called something deeply hidden he writes one of my favorite blogs on his website preposterousuniversecom i recommend clicking on the greatest hits link that lists accessible interesting posts on the arrow of time dark matter dark energy the big bang general relativity string theory quantum mechanics and the big meta questions about the philosophy of science god ethics politics academia and much much more finally and perhaps most famously hes the host of a podcast called mindscape that you should subscribe to and support on patreon along with the joe rogan experience sam harriss making sense and dan carlins hardcore history seans mindscape podcast is one of my favorite ways to learn new ideas or explore different perspectives and ideas that i thought i understood it was truly an honor to meet and spend a couple hours with sean its a bit heartbreaking to say that for the first time ever the audio recorder for this podcast died in the middle of our conversation theres technical reasons for this having to do with phantom power that i now understand and will avoid it took me one hour to notice and fix the problem so much like the universe is 68 dark energy roughly the same amount from this conversation was lost except in the memories of the two people involved and in my notes im sure well talk again and continue this conversation on this podcast or on seans and of course i look forward to it this is the artificial intelligence podcast if you enjoy it subscribe on youtube itunes support it on patreon or simply connect with me on twitter at lex friedman and now heres my conversation with sean carroll what do you think is more interesting and impactful understanding how the universe works at a fundamental level or understanding how the human mind works you know of course this is a crazy meaningless unanswerable question in some sense because theyre both very interesting and theres no absolute scale of interestingness that we can rate them on theres a glib answer that says the human brain is part of the universe right and therefore understanding the universe is more fundamental than understanding the human brain but do you really believe that once we understand the fundamental way the universe works at the particle level the forces we would be able to understand how the mind works no certainly not we cannot understand how ice cream works just from understanding how particles work right so im a big believer in emergence im a big believer that there are different ways of talking about the world beyond just the most fundamental microscopic one you know when we talk about tables and chairs and planets and people were not talking the language of particle physics and cosmology so but understanding the universe you didnt say just at the most fundamental level right so understanding the universe at all levels is part of that i do think you know to be a little bit more fair to the question there probably are general principles of complexity biology information processing memory knowledge creativity that go beyond just the human brain right and maybe one could count understanding those as part of understanding the universe the human brain as far as we know is the most complex thing in the universe so theres its certainly absurd to think that by understanding the fundamental laws of particle physics you get any direct insight on how the brain works but then theres this step from the fundamentals of particle physics to information processing which a lot of physicists and philosophers may be a little bit carelessly take when they talk about artificial intelligence do you think of the universe as a kind of a computational device no to be like the honest answer there is no theres a sense in which the universe processes information clearly theres a sense in which the universe is like a computer clearly but in some sense i think i tried to say this once on my blog and no one agreed with me but the universe is more like a computation than a computer because the universe happens once a computer is a general purpose machine right that you can ask it different questions even a pocket calculator right and its set up to answer certain kinds of questions the universe isnt that so information processing happens in the universe but its not what the universe is and i know your mit colleague seth lloyd feels very differently about this right well youre thinking of the universe as a closed system i am so what makes a computer more like a pc like a computing machine is that theres a human that every once comes up to it and moves the mouse around so input gives it input gives it input and thats why youre saying its just a computation a deterministic thing thats just unrolling but the immense complexity of it is nevertheless like processing theres a state and then it changes with good rules and theres a sense for a lot of people that if the brain operates the human brain operates within that world then its simply just a small subset of that and so theres no reason we cant build arbitrarily great intelligences yeah do you think of intelligence in this way intelligence is tricky i dont have a definition of it offhand so i remember this panel discussion that i saw on youtube i wasnt there but seth lloyd was on the panel and so was martin rees the famous astrophysicist and seth gave his shtick for why the universe is a computer and explained this and martin rees said so what is not a computer and seth was like oh thats a good question im not sure because if you have a sufficiently broad definition of what a computer is then everything is right and the simile or the analogy gains force when it excludes some things you know is the moon going around the earth performing a computation i can come up with definitions in which the answer is yes but its not a very useful computation i think that its absolutely helpful to think about the universe in certain situations certain contexts as an information processing device im even guilty of writing a paper called quantum circuit cosmology where we modeled the whole universe as a quantum circuit as a circuit as a circuit yeah with qubits kind of thing with qubits basically right yeah so and qubits becoming more and more entangled so do we wanna digress a little bit lets do it its kind of fun so heres a mystery about the universe that is so deep and profound that nobody talks about it space expands right and we talk about in a certain region of space a certain number of degrees of freedom a certain number of ways that the quantum fields and the particles in that region can arrange themselves that number of degrees of freedom in a region of space is arguably finite we actually dont know how many there are but theres a very good argument that says its a finite number so as the universe expands and space gets bigger are there more degrees of freedom if its an infinite number it doesnt really matter infinity times two is still infinity but if its a finite number then theres more space so theres more degrees of freedom so where did they come from that would mean the universe is not a closed system theres more degrees of freedom popping into existence so what we suggested was that there are more degrees of freedom and its not that theyre not there to start but theyre not entangled to start so the universe that you and i know of the three dimensions around us that we see we said those are the entangled degrees of freedom making up space time and as the universe expands there are a whole bunch of qubits in their zero state that become entangled with the rest of space time through the action of these quantum circuits so what does it mean that theres now more degrees of freedom as they become more entangled yeah so as the universe expands thats right so theres more and more degrees of freedom that are entangled that are playing part playing the role of part of the entangled space time structure so the basic the underlying philosophy is that space time itself arises from the entanglement of some fundamental quantum degrees of freedom wow okay so at which point is most of the entanglement happening are we talking about close to the big bang are we talking about throughout the time of the life throughout history yeah so the idea is that at the big bang almost all the degrees of freedom that the universe could have were there but they were unentangled with anything else and thats a reflection of the fact that the big bang had a low entropy it was a very simple very small place and as space expands more and more degrees of freedom become entangled with the rest of the world well i have to ask john carroll what do you think of the thought experiment from nick bostrom that were living in a simulation so i think let me contextualize that a little bit more i think people dont actually take this thought experiments i think its quite interesting its not very useful but its quite interesting from the perspective of ai a lot of the learning that can be done usually happens in simulation from artificial examples and so its a constructive question to ask how difficult is our real world to simulate right which is kind of a dual part of if were living in a simulation and somebody built that simulation if you were to try to do it yourself how hard would it be so obviously we could be living in a simulation if you just want the physical possibility then i completely agree that its physically possible i dont think that we actually are so take this one piece of data into consideration you know we live in a big universe okay theres two trillion galaxies in our observable universe with 200 billion stars in each galaxy et cetera it would seem to be a waste of resources to have a universe that big going on just to do a simulation so in other words i want to be a good bayesian i want to ask under this hypothesis what do i expect to see so the first thing i would say is i wouldnt expect to see a universe that was that big okay the second thing is i wouldnt expect the resolution of the universe to be as good as it is so its always possible that if our superhuman simulators only have finite resources that they dont render the entire universe right that the part that is out there the two trillion galaxies isnt actually being simulated fully okay but then the obvious extrapolation of that is that only i am being simulated fully like the rest of you are just non player characters right im the only thing that is real the rest of you are just chat bots beyond this wall i see the wall but there is literally nothing on the other side of the wall that is sort of the bayesian prediction thats what it would be like to do an efficient simulation of me so like none of that seems quite realistic i dont see i hear the argument that its just possible and easy to simulate lots of things i dont see any evidence from what we know about our universe that we look like a simulated universe now maybe you can say well we dont know what it would look like but thats just abandoning your bayesian responsibilities like your job is to say under this theory heres what you would expect to see yeah so certainly if you think about simulation as a thing thats like a video game where only a small subset is being rendered but say the entire all the laws of physics the entire closed system of the quote unquote universe it had a creator yeah its always possible right so thats not useful to think about when youre thinking about physics the way nick bostrom phrases it if its possible to simulate a universe eventually well do it right you can use that by the way for a lot of things well yeah but i guess the question is how hard is it to create a universe i wrote a little blog post about this and maybe im missing something but theres an argument that says not only that it might be possible to simulate a universe but probably if you imagine that you actually attribute consciousness and agency to the little things that were simulating to our little artificial beings theres probably a lot more of them than there are ordinary organic beings in the universe or there will be in the future right so theres an argument that not only is being a simulation possible its probable because in the space of all living consciousnesses most of them are being simulated right most of them are not at the top level i think that argument must be wrong because it follows from that argument that if were simulated but we can also simulate other things well but if we can simulate other things they can simulate other things right if we give them enough power and resolution and ultimately well reach a bottom because the laws of physics in our universe have a bottom were made of atoms and so forth so there will be the cheapest possible simulations and if you believe the original argument you should conclude that we should be in the cheapest possible simulation because thats where most people are but we dont look like that it doesnt look at all like were at the edge of resolution that were 16 bit things it seems much easier to make much lower level things than we are and also i questioned the whole approach to the anthropic principle that says we are typical observers in the universe i think that thats not actually i think that theres a lot of selection that we can do that were typical within things we already know but not typical within all of the universe so do you think theres intelligent life however you would like to define intelligent life out there in the universe my guess is that there is not intelligent life in the observable universe other than us simply on the basis of the fact that the likely number of other intelligent species in the observable universe theres two likely numbers zero or billions and if there had been billions you would have noticed already for there to be literally like a small number like you know star trek theres a dozen intelligent civilizations in our galaxy but not a billion thats weird thats sort of bizarre to me its easy for me to imagine that there are zero others because theres just a big bottleneck to making multicellular life or technological life or whatever its very hard for me to imagine that theres a whole bunch out there that have somehow remained hidden from us the question id like to ask is what would intelligent life look like what i mean by that question and where its going is what if intelligent life is just in some very big ways different than the one that has on earth that theres all kinds of intelligent life that operates at different scales of both size and temporal right thats a great possibility because i think we should be humble about what intelligence is what life is we dont even agree on what life is much less what intelligent life is right so thats an argument for humility saying there could be intelligent life of a very different character right like you could imagine the dolphins are intelligent but never invent space travel because they live in the ocean and they dont have thumbs right so they never invent technology they never invent smelting maybe the universe is full of intelligent species that just dont make technology right thats compatible with the data i think and i think maybe what youre pointing at is even more out there versions of intelligence intelligence in intermolecular clouds or on the surface of a neutron star or in between the galaxies in giant things where the equivalent of a heartbeat is 100 million years on the one hand yes we should be very open minded about those things on the other hand all of us share the same laws of physics there might be something about the laws of physics even though we dont currently know exactly what that thing would be that makes meters and years the right length and timescales for intelligent life maybe not but were made of atoms atoms have a certain size we orbit stars or stars have a certain lifetime its not impossible to me that theres a sweet spot for intelligent life that we find ourselves in so im open minded either way im open minded either being humble and theres all sorts of different kinds of life or no theres a reason we just dont know it yet why life like ours is the kind of life thats out there yeah im of two minds too but i often wonder if our brains is just designed to quite obviously to operate and see the world in these timescales and were almost blind and the tools weve created for detecting things are blind to the kind of observation needed to see intelligent life at other scales well im totally open to that but so heres another argument i would make we have looked for intelligent life but weve looked at for it in the dumbest way we can by turning radio telescopes to the sky and why in the world would a super advanced civilization randomly beam out radio signals wastefully in all directions into the universe that just doesnt make any sense especially because in order to think that you would actually contact another civilization you would have to do it forever you have to keep doing it for millions of years that sounds like a waste of resources if you thought that there were other solar systems with planets around them where maybe intelligent life didnt yet exist but might someday you wouldnt try to talk to it with radio waves you would send a spacecraft out there and you would park it around there and it would be like from our point of view itd be like 2001 where there was a monolith monolith there could be an artifact in fact the other way works also right there could be artifacts in our solar system that have been put there by other technologically advanced civilizations and thats how we will eventually contact them we just havent explored the solar system well enough yet to find them the reason why we dont think about that is because were young and impatient right like it would take more than my lifetime to actually send something to another star system and wait for it and then come back so but if we start thinking on hundreds of thousands of years or million year time scales thats clearly the right thing to do are you excited by the thing that elon musk is doing with spacex in general space but the idea of space exploration even though your or your species is young and impatient yeah no i do think that space travel is crucially important long term even to other star systems and i think that many people overestimate the difficulty because they say look if you travel 1 the speed of light to another star system well be dead before we get there right and i think that its much easier and therefore when they write their science fiction stories they imagine wed go faster than the speed of light because otherwise theyre too impatient right were not gonna go faster than the speed of light but we could easily imagine that the human lifespan gets extended to thousands of years and once you do that then the stars are much closer effectively right and then whats a hundred year trip right so i think that thats gonna be the future the far future not my lifetime once again but baby steps unless your lifetime gets extended well its in a race against time right a friend of mine who actually thinks about these things said you know you and i are gonna die but i dont know about our grandchildren thats i dont know predicting the future is hard but thats at least a plausible scenario and so yeah no i think that as we discussed earlier there are threats to the earth known and unknown right having spread humanity and biology elsewhere is a really important longterm goal what kind of questions can science not currently answer but might soon when you think about the problems and the mysteries before us that may be within reach of science i think an obvious one is the origin of life we dont know how that happened theres a difficulty in knowing how it happened historically actually you know literally on earth but starting life from non life is something i kind of think were close to right were really you really think so like how difficult is it to start life well ive talked to people including on the podcast about this you know life requires three things life as we know it so theres a difference with life which who knows what it is and life as we know it which we can talk about with some intelligence so life as we know it requires compartmentalization you need like a little membrane around your cell metabolism you need to take in food and eat it and let that make you do things and then replication okay so you need to have some information about who you are that you pass down to future generations in the lab compartmentalization seems pretty easy not hard to make lipid bilayers that come into little cellular walls pretty easily metabolism and replication are hard but replication were close to people have made rna like molecules in the lab that i think the state of the art is theyre not able to make one molecule that reproduces itself but theyre able to make two molecules that reproduce each other so thats okay thats pretty close metabolism is harder believe it or not even though its sort of the most obvious thing but you want some sort of controlled metabolism and the actual cellular machinery in our bodies is quite complicated its hard to see it just popping into existence all by itself it probably took a while but were making progress and in fact i dont think were spending nearly enough money on it if i were the nsf i would flood this area with money because it would change our view of the world if we could actually make life in the lab and understand how it was made originally here on earth and im sure itd have some ripple effects that help cure disease and so on i mean just that understanding so synthetic biology is a wonderful big frontier where were making cells right now the best way to do that is to borrow heavily from existing biology right well craig venter several years ago created an artificial cell but all he did was not all he did it was a tremendous accomplishment but all he did was take out the dna from a cell and put in entirely new dna and let it boot up and go what about the leap to creating intelligent life on earth yeah again we define intelligence of course but lets just even say homo sapiens the modern intelligence in our human brain do you have a sense of whats involved in that leap and how big of a leap that is so ai would count in this or do you really want life do you want really an organism in some sense ai would count i think okay yeah of course of course ai would count well lets say artificial consciousness right so i do not think we are on the threshold of creating artificial consciousness i think its possible im not again very educated about how close we are but my impression is not that were really close because we understand how little we understand of consciousness and what it is so if we dont have any idea what it is its hard to imagine were on the threshold of making it ourselves but its doable its possible i dont see any obstacles in principle so yeah i would hold out some interest in that happening eventually i think in general consciousness i think we would be just surprised how easy consciousness is once we create intelligence i think consciousness is a thing thats just something we all fake well good no actually i like this idea that in fact consciousness is way less mysterious than we think because were all at every time at every moment less conscious than we think we are right we can fool things and i think that plus the idea that you not only have artificial intelligent systems but you put them in a body right give them a robot body that will help the faking a lot yeah i think creating consciousness in artificial consciousness is as simple as asking a roomba to say im conscious and refusing to be talked out of it could be it could be and i mean im almost being silly but thats what we do thats what we do with each other this is the kind of that consciousness is also a social construct and a lot of our ideas of intelligence is a social construct and so reaching that bar involves something thats beyond that doesnt necessarily involve the fundamental understanding of how you go from electrons to neurons to cognition no actually i think that is an extremely good point and in fact what it suggests is so yeah you referred to kate darling who i had on the podcast and who does these experiments with very simple robots but they look like animals and they can look like theyre experiencing pain and we human beings react very negatively to these little robots looking like theyre experiencing pain and what you wanna say is yeah but theyre just robots its not really pain right its just some electrons going around but then you realize you and i are just electrons going around and thats what pain is also and so what i would have an easy time imagining is that there is a spectrum between these simple little robots that kate works with and a human being where there are things that sort of by some strict definition turing test level thing are not conscious but nevertheless walk and talk like theyre conscious and it could be that the future is i mean siri is close right and so it might be the future has a lot more agents like that and in fact rather than someday going aha we have consciousness well just creep up on it with more and more accurate reflections of what we expect and in the future maybe the present for example we havent met before and youre basically assuming that im human as its a high probability at this time because the yeah but in the future there might be question marks around that right yeah no absolutely certainly videos are almost to the point where you shouldnt trust them already photos you cant trust right videos is easier to trust but were getting worse that were getting better at faking them right yeah so physical embodied people whats so hard about faking that so this is very depressing this conversation were having right now so i mean to me its exciting to me youre doing it so its exciting to you but its a sobering thought were very bad right at imagining what the next 50 years are gonna be like when were in the middle of a phase transition as we are right now yeah and i in general im not blind to all the threats i am excited by the power of technology to solve to protect us against the threats as they evolve im not as much as steven pinker optimistic about the world but in everything ive seen all of the brilliant people in the world that ive met are good people so the army of the good in terms of the development of technology is large okay youre way more optimistic than i am i think that goodness and badness are equally distributed among intelligent and unintelligent people i dont see much of a correlation there interesting neither of us have proof yeah exactly again opinions are free right nor definitions of good and evil we come without definitions or without data opinions so what kind of questions can science not currently answer and may never be able to answer in your view well the obvious one is what is good and bad what is right and wrong i think that there are questions that science tells us what happens what the world is and what it does it doesnt say what the world should do or what we should do because were part of the world but we are part of the world and we have the ability to feel like somethings right somethings wrong and to make a very long story very short i think that the idea of moral philosophy is systematizing our intuitions of what is right and what is wrong and science might be able to predict ahead of time what we will do but it wont ever be able to judge whether we should have done it or not so youre kind of unique in terms of scientists listen it doesnt have to do with podcasts but even just reaching out i think you referred to as sort of doing interdisciplinary science so you reach out and talk to people that are outside of your discipline which i always hope thats what science was for in fact i was a little disillusioned when i realized that academia is very siloed yeah and so the question is how at your own level how do you prepare for these conversations how do you think about these conversations how do you open your mind enough to have these conversations and it may be a little bit broader how can you advise other scientists to have these kinds of conversations not at the podcast the fact that youre doing a podcast is awesome other people get to hear them but its also good to have it without mics in general its a good question but a tough one to answer i think about a guy i know whos a personal trainer and he was asked on a podcast how do we psych ourselves up to do a workout how do we make that discipline to go and work out and hes like why are you asking me i cant stop working out i dont need to psych myself up so and likewise he asked me how do you get to have interdisciplinary conversations on all sorts of different things all sorts of different people im like thats what makes me go right like thats i couldnt stop doing that i did that long before any of them were recorded in fact a lot of the motivation for starting recording it was making sure i would read all these books that i had purchased right like all these books i wanted to read not enough time to read them and now if i have the motivation cause im gonna interview pat churchland im gonna finally read her book you know and its absolutely true that academia is extraordinarily siloed right we dont talk to people we rarely do and in fact when we do its punished you know like the people who do it successfully generally first became very successful within their little siloed discipline and only then did they start expanding out if youre a young person you know i have graduate students i try to be very very candid with them about this that its you know most graduate students are to not become faculty members right its a tough road and so live the life you wanna live but do it with your eyes open about what it does to your job chances and the more broad you are and the less time you spend hyper specializing in your field the lower your job chances are thats just an academic reality its terrible i dont like it but its a reality and for some people thats fine like theres plenty of people who are wonderful scientists who have zero interest in branching out and talking to things to anyone outside their field but it is disillusioning to me some of the you know romantic notion i had of the intellectual academic life is belied by the reality of it the idea that we should reach out beyond our discipline and that is a positive good is just so rare in universities that it may as well not exist at all but that said even though youre saying youre doing it like the personal trainer because you just cant help it youre also an inspiration to others like i could speak for myself you know i also have a career im thinking about right and without your podcast i may have not have been doing this at all right so it makes me realize that these kinds of conversations is kind of what science is about in many ways the reason we write papers this exchange of ideas is its much harder to do interdisciplinary papers i would say and conversations are easier so conversations is the beginning and in the field of ai its obvious that we should think outside of pure computer vision competitions on a particular data sets we should think about the broader impact of how this can be you know reaching out to physics to psychology to neuroscience and having these conversations so that youre an inspiration and so never know how the world changes i mean the fact that this stuff is out there and ive a huge number of people come up to me grad students really loving the podcast inspired by it and they will probably have that theyll be ripple effects when they become faculty and so on and so on we can end on a balance between pessimism and optimism and sean thank you so much for talking to me it was awesome no lex thank you very much for this conversation it was great\"\n

machine learning computer science youre trivially called michael jordan machine learning although know born first technically mj michael jordan basketball anyway favorite yann lecun calling miles davis machine learning says reinvent periodically sometimes leave fans scratching heads change direction put first historian hat give history computer science ai saw experienced including four generations ai successes ive seen talk sure yeah first much prefer yanns metaphor miles davis real explorer jazz coherent story think one one lived one think later historian look back revisit think whats happening right ai intellectual aspiration thats still alive today aspiration think akin development chemical engineering chemistry electrical engineering electromagnetism go back 30s 40s wasnt yet chemical engineering chemistry fluid flow mechanics people pretty clearly viewed interesting goals try build factories make chemicals products viably safely make good ones scale people started try course factories worked didnt viable exploded parallel developed whole field called chemical engineering electrical engineering field bones theoretical aspects practical aspects engineering quote unquote real thing real concepts needed thing electrical engineering maxwells equations sense everything know electromagnetism needed figure build circuits build modules put together bring electricity one point another safely forth whole field developed called electrical engineering think thats whats happening right proto field statistics theoretical side algorithmic side computer science enough start build things things systems bring value human beings use human data mix human decisions engineering side ad hoc thats whats emerging fact wanna call machine learning field think thats proto form engineering based statistical computational ideas previous generations think theres something deeper ai dreams aspirations compared chemical engineering electrical engineering well dreams aspirations maybe 500 years think thats like greeks sitting saying would neat get moon someday think clue brain computation clueless even worse greeks anything interesting scientifically era linger moment stand completely unique little bit unique clarity elaborate intuition like stand understanding human brain lot people say know scientists say far understanding human brain youre like youre saying dark well know im unique dont even think clarity talk real neuroscientists really study real synapses real neurons agree agree hundreds year task theyre building slowly surely signal clear think metaphors think electrical maybe chemical whole soup ions proteins cell thats even around like single synapse look electron micrograph single synapse city thats one little thing dendritic tree extremely complicated electrochemical thing spikes voltages flying around proteins taking taking dna knows problem next centuries fantastic metaphors economic device like immune system like layered set know arithmetic computations metaphors theyre fun thats real science per se neuroscience thats neuroscience right thats like greek speculating get moon fun right think like say fairly strongly think lot young people think verge lot people dont talk clearly let understood yes kind brain inspired kind close know breakthroughs horizon thats scrupulous people sometimes need money labs thats im saying scrupulous people oversell need money lab im studying computational neuroscience im going oversell theres much ill step gray area metaphor engineering im sure youre familiar brain computer interfaces company like elon musk neuralink thats working putting electrodes brain trying able read read send electrical signals said even basic mechanism communication brain something understand hope without understanding fundamental principles brain works well able something interesting gray area metaphor area hope sense like anybody else hopes interesting things happen research would expect something like alzheimers get figured modern neuroscience theres lot human suffering based brain disease throw things like lithium brain kind works one clue thats quite true mostly dont know thats even biochemistry brain leads mood swings thought emerges really really completely dim might want hook electrodes try signal processing try find patterns fine means go scientific point like kind sitting satellite watching emissions city trying infer things microeconomy even though dont microeconomic concepts really kind thing yes find signals something interesting useful control cursor mouse brain yeah absolutely imagine business models based even medical applications understanding algorithms allow us really tie deeply brain computer dont agree elon musk dont think thats even thats generations even century hopes getting dream youve mentioned kolmogorov turing might pop think might breakthroughs get sit back five 10 years say wow oh im sure dont think therell demos impress dont think computer call restaurant pretend human breakthrough right people know people present imitating human intelligence even putting coughs thing make bit pr stunt fine world runs things dont want diminish hard work engineering goes behind things like ultimate value human race thats scientific understanding know people work things scientific understanding meantime theyve got kind know trains got run got mouths feed got things theres nothing wrong would call though engineering want distinguish engineering field like electrical engineering chemical engineering originally emerged real principles really know youre little scientific understanding maybe even complete became predictable really gave value human life understood dont want muddle much waters know able versus really cant way thats going impress next dont need wowed think someone comes along 20 years younger person whos absorbed technology wowed think deeply impressed young kolmogorov would wowed stunts see right coming big companies demos think breakthroughs kolmogorov would give question chance think therell scientific fundamental principles arena think possible fundamental breakthroughs engineering meaning know would say things elon musk working spacex others sort trying revolutionize fundamentals engineering manufacturing saying heres problem know demo actually taking scale yeah theres going kinds breakthroughs dont like terminology im scientist work things day day things move along eventually say wow something happened dont like language much also dont like prize theoretical breakthroughs practical ones tend theoretician think theres lots arena right wouldnt point kolmogorovs might point edisons era maybe musk bit like know musk god bless also say things ai knows little leads people astray talks things doesnt know anything trying program computer understand natural language involved dialogue right aint going happen lifetime could fake mimic sort take old sentences humans use retread deep understanding language going happen hope perceive deeper yet deeper kind aspects intelligence going happen breakthroughs think google breakthrough think amazon breakthrough know think uber breakthrough know bring value human beings scale new brand new ways based data flows lot things slightly broken theres kind engineering field takes economic value context data know planetary scale worries externalities privacy know dont field dont think things well see emerging know looking back 100 years constituted breakthrough era like electrical engineering breakthrough early part last century chemical engineering breakthrough scale markets talk well get seen sort breakthrough early days really interesting stuff well get taking quick step back give kind throw historian hat mean briefly said history ai kind mimics history chemical engineering keep saying machine learning keep wanting say ai let know dont know resist dont think ai really john mccarthy almost philosopher saying wouldnt cool could put thought computer could mimic human capability think put intelligence sense computer thats interesting philosophical question wanted make philosophy wanted actually write logical formula algorithms would perfectly valid reasonable thing thats whats happening era reason keep saying ai actually id love hear think machine learning particular set methods tools maybe version mine doesnt open optimization sampling systems learn machine learning systems learn make decisions make decisions pattern recognition know finding patterns making decisions real worlds close feedback loops something like symbolic ai expert systems reasoning systems knowledge based representation kinds things search neighbor fit think machine learning dont even like word machine learning think field youre talking making large collections decisions uncertainty large collections entities right principles scale dont say principles single entity thats making decisions single agent single human really immediately goes network decisions good word theres good words thats kind part problem continue conversation use ai want kind raise flag dont know intelligence real intelligence dont know much abstraction reasoning level humans dont clue trying build dont clue eventually may emerge theyll make dont know therell breakthroughs eventually well start get glimmers whats happening right okay taking data trying make good decisions based trying scale trying economically viably trying build markets trying keep value scale aspects look intelligent computers dumb seem intelligent use buzzword intelligence use sense machine learning scope narrowly learning data pattern recognition talk topics maybe data science another word could throw mix really important decisions part consequential decisions real world going medical operation going drive street things theres scarcity things impact human beings environments based data adaptively use computers help kinds things go forward whatever want call lets call ai lets agree call ai lets say goal intelligence goal really good working systems planetary scale weve never seen reclaim word ai dartmouth conference many decades ago dream humans dont want reclaim want new word think bad choice mean read one little things history basically mccarthy needed new name cybernetics already existed didnt like one really liked norbert wiener norbert wiener kind island felt encompassed sense look language cybernetics everything talking control theory signal processing notions intelligence closed feedback loops data word lived partly maybe personalities mccarthy needed new word say im different im part show got invented word thinking forward movies would made great choice thinking forward creating sober academic real world discipline terrible choice led promises true understand understand artificial perhaps dont understand intelligence small tangent youre one great personalities machine learning whatever heck call field think science progresses personalities fundamental principles theories research thats outside personalities wouldnt say one kind personality mine preferences kind network around feeds agree disagree kinds personalities needed right think personality little exuberant little bit ready promise moon little bit much ascendance think theres good certainly attracts lots young people field lot people come strong misconceptions unlearn find something think theres got multiple voices wasnt hearing enough sober voice continuation fun tangent speaking vibrant personalities would yeah think technically speaking possible help dont know answers less anonymity little locality know worlds kind enter trust people worlds start discussion know people going hurt going total waste time theres lot wasting time know lot us pulled facebook early cause clearly going waste lot time even though value yeah worlds somehow enter know youre getting kind appeals might new things might happen kind trust world theres deep interesting complex psychological aspects around anonymity changes human behavior thats quite dark quite dark yeah think lot us especially us really loved advent technology love social networks came didnt see negatives started seeing comment sections think maybe know cnn something started go wow darkness know technology amplifying sorry big philosophical question topic think human beings cause youve also things foot psychology think human beings fundamentally good like us good intent could mind depending context environment everybody could evil answer fundamentally good fundamentally limited us know blinkers dont see persons pain easily dont see persons point view easily much head world good days think technology could open us know perspectives less blinkered understanding know lot wars human history happened ignorance didnt thought person person wasnt huge amounts lifetime ive seen technology really help way yet believe know think fundamentally humans good people suffer people grievances grudges things cause things probably wouldnt want regret often think know part progress technology indeed allow little easier real good person actually well think individual human life society could modeled optimization problem way think typically mean thats youre talking one complex phenomenon whole know individual human life society whole mean individual human life amazingly complex know optimization kind one branch mathematics talks certain kinds things feels way limited complexity things properties optimization problems think think interesting problems could solved optimization kind properties surface non convexity convexity linearity kinds things saddle points well optimization one piece mathematics know theres like even era aware say sampling coming examples something coming distribution whats optimization whats sampling well youre kind certain kind mathematician try blend make seem sort thing optimization roughly speaking trying find point single point optimum criterion function kind sampling trying surface treat distribution density find points high density want entire distribution sampling paradigm want know single point thats best point optimization paradigm optimizing space probability measures output could whole probability distribution start make things mathematics go high kind abstraction hierarchy start lose know ability interesting theorems kind dont try dont try overly abstract small tangent kind worldview find appealing one deterministic stochastic well thats easy mean im statistician know world highly stochastic dont know whats going happen next five minutes right youre going ask going ill say due uncertainty due massive uncertainty yeah know massive uncertainty best come rough sense probability distribution things somehow use reasoning distributed scale multi agent systems look like optimization optimize sort makes lot sense sort least robotics perspective single robot single agent trying optimize objective function start enter real world game theoretic concept starts popping thats see optimization youve talked markets scale look like see optimization see sampling see like mark blend together system designer thinking build incentivized system blend things know particle potential well optimizing functional called lagrangian right particle doesnt know theres algorithm running happens description mathematically something helps us understand analysts whats happening right thing happen talk know mixtures humans computers markets forth therell certain principles allow us understand whats happening whether actual algorithms used sense clear point may set multi agent market kind system im thinking individual agent system theyre asked task theyre incentivized way get certain signals utility point wont know answer may optimize find answer okay artist could embedded inside overall market know game theory broad often studied narrowly certain kinds problems roughly speaking dont know youre going kind anticipate little bit anticipate im anticipating kind go back forth minds run kind thought experiments youve talked interesting point terms game theory know optimization problems really hate saddle points maybe describe saddle points ive heard kind mentioned theres theres branch optimization could try explicitly look saddle points good thing oh optimization thats game theory theres kinds different equilibria game theory highly explanatory behavior theyre attempting algorithmic theyre trying say happen equilibrium would see certain kind behavior see real life thats economist wants especially behavioral economists continuous differential game theory youre continuous spaces simplest equilibria saddle points nash equilibrium saddle point special kind saddle point classically game theory trying find nash equilibria algorithmic game theory youre trying find algorithms would find youre trying find saddle points mean thats literally youre trying know economist knows nash equilibria limitations definitely explanatory many situations theyre really want theres kind equilibria theres names associated came history certain people working new ones emerging know one example stackelberg equilibrium know nash playing game maybe cooperative going think going decide going thing simultaneously know stackelberg im going first mover im going make move youre going look move youre going make since know youre going look move anticipate youre going dont something stupid know also anticipating kind going back forth first mover thing different equilibria right mathematically yeah things certain topologies certain shapes like whats algorithmically dynamically move towards move away things know questions answers theyve studied others especially becomes stochastic especially theres large numbers decentralized things theres know young people get field kind think done know tensorflow well open problems theyre really important interesting strategic settings collect data suppose dont know youre going dont know well right well got collect data maybe want push part space dont know much get data cause later ill realize youll never youll never go way game set know thats part overall know data analysis context even game poker fascinating space whenever theres uncertainty lack information super exciting space linger optimization second look deep learning essentially minimization complicated loss function something insightful hopeful see kinds function surface loss functions deep learning real world trying optimize something interesting usual kind problems optimization think optimization point view surface first pretty smooth secondly theres parameterized theres kind lots paths reasonable optima kind getting downhill optimum viewed hard mightve expected high dimensions fact optima tend really good ones others good tend sometimes find good ones sort still needs explanation yeah particular surface coming particular generation neural nets kind suspect change 10 years exactly surfaces therell others optimization theory help contribute surfaces algorithms years arithmetic operations little bit nonlinearity thats didnt come neuroscience per se mean maybe minds people working thinking brains arithmetic circuits kinds fields computer science control theory layers could transform things certain ways smooth maybe could find parameter values sort big discovery working able work scale dont think stuck certainly stuck cause understanding brain terms algorithm side sort gradient descent think stuck gradient descent variance variance find interesting think therell something else invented able walk optimization spaces interesting ways theres co design surface architecture algorithm ask stay kind architectures neural nets know phase retrieval architectures matrix completion architectures know think weve kind come place yeah stochastic gradient algorithms dominant versions little better others guarantees theyre robust theres ongoing research kind figure best arm situation think thatll start co evolve thatll put pressure actual architecture shouldnt particular way different way algorithm available different way cant really anticipate co evolution process know gradients amazing mathematical objects lot people start study deeply mathematically kind shocked think way suppose tell move along x axis go uphill objective three units whereas move along axis go uphill seven units right im going allow move certain unit distance right going well people say im going go along axis im getting biggest bang buck know buck one unit im going put axis right even take strength step size put x axis im getting less bang buck seems like completely clear argument wrong gradient direction go along axis take little bit x axis understand know math even trivial called operator like gradient trivial know exploiting properties still important know pervading descent got kinds problems gets stuck many ways never know good dimension dependence line work recently kinds stochasticity get dimension dependence theory weve come pretty favorable results certain kinds stochasticity sufficient conditions generally know give good guarantee dont necessary conditions must done certain way general stochasticity much randomness inject walking along gradient kind randomness randomness good process stochasticity good yeah give simple answers sense kind amazing stochasticity know particular features surface could hurt one thing deterministically wont hurt chance theres little chance would get hurt stochasticity kind saves particular features surfaces fact think surfaces discontinuous first derivative like absolute value function go hit point theres nondifferentiability youre running deterministic algorithm point really something bad whereas stochasticity means pretty unlikely thats going happen youre going hit point nontrivial analyze especially higher dimensions also stochasticity intuition isnt good properties kind appealing high dimensions lot large number reasons part mathematics kind thats whats fun work field get try understand mathematics long story short know partly empirically discovered stochastic gradient effective theory kind followed id say dont see getting clearly whats beautiful mysterious profound idea optimization dont know let say nesterovs work nesterov acceleration pretty surprising pretty deep elaborate well nesterov acceleration suppose going use gradients move around space reasons ive alluded theyre nice directions move suppose tell youre allowed use gradients youre going allowed use local person sense kind change surface im going give kind computer thats able store previous gradients start learn something surface im going restrict maybe move direction like linear span gradients cant kind move arbitrary direction right well defined mathematical complexity model theres certain classes algorithms others cant ask certain kinds surfaces fast get optimum theres answers smooth convex function theres answer one number steps squared within ball size k steps gradient descent particular slower rate one k could ask gradient descent actually even though know good algorithm best algorithm answer well clear yet one k squared lower bound thats probably best gradient one k something better think surprise nesterov discovered new algorithm got two pieces two gradients puts together certain kind obscure way thing doesnt even move downhill time sometimes goes back uphill youre physicist kind makes sense youre building momentum kind right intuition intuition enough understand kind works achieves one k squared mathematical structure still kind day lot us writing papers trying explore understand lots cool ideas optimization kind using gradients think number one goes back know 150 years nesterov think made major contribution idea like said gradients sense mysterious theyre trivial trivial coordinate descent trivial one pick one coordinates thats think thats human mind thinks thats human minds think gradients easy human mind grapple absurd question statistics little bit somewhere math science technology somewhere convex hole set principles allow make inferences got reason believed also principles allow make decisions reason believe youre going make errors requires assumptions mean error mean probabilities start making assumptions youre led conclusions yes guarantee way probability making error small probability continuing make errors time small probability found something thats real small high decision making big part decision making big part yeah statistics short history goes back formal discipline 250 years called inverse probability around era probability developed sort especially explain gambling situations course interesting would say well given state nature theres certain roulette board certain mechanism kind outcomes expect see especially things long amounts time outcomes see physicists started pay attention people said well lets turn problem around saw certain outcomes could infer underlying mechanism thats inverse problem fact quite statistics called inverse probability name field believe laplace working napoleons government needed census france learn people went gathered data analyzed data determine policy said well lets call field kind thing statistics word state french thats etat study data state anyway caught called statistics ever since time got formalized sort 30s around time game theory decision theory developed nearby people era didnt think either computer science statistics control econ von neumann developing game theory also thinking decision theory wald econometrician developing decision theory turning statistics heres data analyze heres loss function heres care heres question youre trying ask probability model heres risk face make certain decisions day advanced statistical curricula teach decision theory starting point branches two branches bayesian frequentist thats decisions statistics beautiful mysterious maybe surprising idea youve come across yeah good question mean theres bunch surprising ones theres something thats way technical thing something called james stein estimation kind surprising really takes time wrap head around try maybe think dont want even want try let say colleague steven stigler university chicago wrote really beautiful paper james stein estimation helps views paradox kind defeats minds attempts understand steve nice perspective one troubles statistics like physics quantum physics multiple interpretations theres wave particle duality physics get used time still kind haunts dont really quite understand relationship electrons wave electrons particle well thing happens theres bayesian ways thinking frequentist different sometimes become sort practice physically different practice give rather different answers much like wave particle duality something kind get used field define bayesian frequentist yeah decision theory make video people could see called bayesian frequentist kind help try make really clear comes decision theory know decision theory youre talking loss functions function data x parameter theta theyre function two arguments okay neither one arguments known dont know data priori random parameters unknown right function two things dont know youre trying say want function small want small loss right well going sort say well im going average quantities maximize something know turn uncertainty something certain could look first argument average could look second argument average thats bayesian frequentist frequentist says im going look x data im going take random im going average distribution take expectation loss x theta held fixed right thats called risk looking data sets could get right say well certain procedure data sets thats called frequentist guarantee right think appropriate like youre building piece software youre shipping people using kinds data sets want stamp guarantee people run many many data sets never even thought 95 time right thing perfectly reasonable bayesian perspective says well im going look argument loss function theta part okay thats unknown im uncertain could personal probability know many tall people im trying infer average height population idea roughly height im going average theta loss function one arguments gone function x thats bayesian say well lets focus particular x got data set got condition conditional x say something loss thats bayesian approach things bayesian argue relevant look data sets could gotten average frequentist approach really data sets got right agree especially situations youre working scientist learn lot domain youre really focused certain kinds data gathered data make inferences dont agree though know sense needs frequentist guarantees youre writing software people using want say something two things got fight little bit blend long story short theres set ideas right middle called empirical bayes empirical bayes sort starts bayesian framework kind arguably philosophically know reasonable kosher write bunch math kind flows realize theres bunch things dont know real world dont know everything youre uncertain certain quantities point ask reasonable way plug estimate things okay cases theres quite reasonable thing plug theres natural thing observe world plug little bit mathematics assure really good based math based human expertise whats good oh theyre going bayesian framework allows put lot human expertise math kind guides along path kind reassures end could put stamp approval certain assumptions thing work asked question whats favorite know whats surprising nice idea one accessible something called false discovery rate know youre making one hypothesis test making one decision youre making whole bag bag decisions look ones made discovery announced something interesting happened right thats going subset big bag ones made discovery subset bad false false discoveries youd like fraction false discoveries among discoveries small thats different criterion accuracy precision recall sensitivity specificity different quantity latter ones almost frequentist flavor say given truth null hypothesis true heres accuracy would get given alternative true heres would get kind going forward state nature data bayesian goes direction data back state nature thats actually false discovery rate says given made discovery okay thats conditioned data whats probability hypothesis going direction classical frequency look well cant know theres priors needed empirical bayesian goes ahead plows forward starts writing formulas realizes point things actually estimated reasonable way kind beautiful set ideas kind line argument come certainly mine sort came robbins around 1960 brad efron written beautifully various papers books fdr know benjamin israel john story bayesian interpretation used absorb things years find healthy way think statistics let ask intelligence jump slightly back philosophy perhaps said maybe elaborate said defining even question intelligence difficult question useful question think well one day understand fundamentals human intelligence means know good benchmarks general intelligence put machines dont work topics much youre really asking question psychologist really studied dont consider least expert point know psychologist aims understand human intelligence right think many psychologists know fairly humble might try understand baby understands know whether somethings solid liquid whether somethings hidden maybe child starts learn meaning certain words whats verb whats noun also know slowly surely trying figure things humans ability take really complicated environment reason abstract find right abstractions communicate interact know really staggeringly rich complicated know think humility dont think kind aiming near future certain psychologist experiments babies lab people talking much limited aspiration know kahneman tversky would look reasoning patterns theyre deeply understanding reasoning theyre sort saying hey heres oddities reasoning things think also emphasize things ive writing know ai revolution hasnt happened yet yeah great blog post ive emphasizing know step back look intelligent systems kind whatever mean intelligence humans animals know plants whatever know market brings goods city know food restaurants something every day system decentralized set decisions looking far enough away like collection neurons every neuron making little decisions presumably way step back enough every little part economic system making decisions like brain knows individual neuron overall goal right something happens aggregate level thing economy people eat city robust works scales small villages big cities working thousands years works rain shine adaptive kind know adjectives one tends apply intelligent systems robust adaptive know dont need keep adjusting self healing whatever plus perfect know intelligences never perfect markets perfect believe era cannot say well computers humans smart know markets markets intelligent humans didnt evolve markets weve participating right market per se neurons could viewed market theres economic know neuroscience kind perspective thats interesting pursue point though study humans really worlds best psychologist studied thousands years come theory human intelligence might never discovered principles markets know supply demand curves know matching auctions real principles lead form intelligence thats maybe human intelligence arguably another kind intelligence probably third kinds intelligence fourth none us really thinking much right really relevant computer systems future certainly market one relevant right whereas understanding human intelligence clear relevant right probably want general intelligence whatever one means know understanding intelligence deep sense definitely human intelligence gotta broader thing thats mystery markets intelligent know definitely philosophical stance say weve got move beyond intelligence sounds ridiculous yeah blog post define different kinds like intelligent infrastructure ai really like concepts youve describing see see earth human civilization single organism think intelligence organism think perspective markets intelligence infrastructure increasing increasing linearly increasing exponentially think future intelligence yeah dont know dont tend think dont tend answer questions like know thats science fiction im hoping catch guard well said far future fun ask youll probably know like said predicting future really nearly impossible say axiom one day create human level superhuman level intelligent scale markets scale individual think think would take maybe ask another question would system different biological human beings see around us today possible say anything interesting question stupid question stupid question science fiction science fiction im totally happy read science fiction think time life loved like brain vat kind know little thing people talking student remember know imagine know brain body theres know theres bunch wires right suppose every one replaced literal wire suppose wire turned actually little wireless know theres receiver sender brain got senders receiver know exiting know axons dendrites body replaced senders receivers could move body somewhere put brain vat right could things like start killing senders receivers one one youve killed person know thought body walking around world moved science fiction things fun think intriguing thought think every 18 year old take philosophy classes think things think everyone think could happen society thats kind bad really dont think thats right thing us age group thinking really think many present know first challenges dangers real things build know spending much time science fiction least public like think maybe beers private thats right well im going broadcast beers going go facebook dont want lot people showing yeah ill love facebook twitter amazon youtube im optimistic hopeful maybe maybe dont grounds optimism hope let ask youve mentored brightest sort seminal figures field give advice people undergraduates today take take know advice journey theyre interested machine learning ideas markets economics psychology kinds things youve exploring steps take journey well yeah first door open second journey like language youre brilliant great brilliant ideas therefore thats know thats success thats enter field apprentice spend lot time work hard things try pull back broad talk lots people like entering kind creative community theres years needed human connections critical know think know musician artist something dont know immediately day one know youre genius therefore know practice really really hard basics humble realize youll never expert everything kind pick theres lot randomness lot kind luck luck kind picks branch tree go youll go branch yeah community graduate school still think one wonderful phenomena world much apprenticeship advisor much group people belong four five year process plenty time start kind nothing come something know expertise start creativity start flower even surprising self cooperative endeavor think lot people think science highly competitive think fields might way cooperative might imagine people always teaching something people always happy clear feel im expert certain kinds things im much expert lots things lot relevant lot know society know dont im always willing reveal ignorance people around teach things think lot us feel way field cooperative might add also international cooperative see barriers nationalism see especially current era everything odds way us think human endeavor cooperate much trying together know benefit everybody last question learn french language beautiful english french great question first think italian actually beautiful french english also speak im married italian kids speak italian anyway kidding aside every language allows express things bit differently one great fun things life explore things fact kids teens college students ask study say well heart heart certainly lot math math good everybody poetry history language know throughout life youll want thinking person youll want done french learned id say late teen living middle country kansas much going kansas due respect kansas parents happened french books shelf boredom pulled found fun kind learned language reading first heard spoken idea spoken realized somehow knew previous life made connection traveled love go beyond barriers comfort whatever found trains france next say older people lived whole life ability communicate special ability also see peoples shoes empathy kind work language part kind experience also embedding french culture quite amazing languages rich theres something inherently beautiful creativity went learned lot songs read poems read books actually mit podcast today young professor yet married lot friends area didnt kind bored person said heard lot italians around theres happened lot italians mit italian professor reason kind vaguely understanding talking said well learn language later met spouse italian became part life go china lot days go asia go europe every time go kind amazed richness human experience people dont idea havent traveled kind amazingly rich love diversity buzzword really means something love embed peoples experiences yeah learning language big part think ive said interview point millions dollars infinite time whatever would really work really wanted ai natural language really done right deep understanding language thats amazingly interesting scientific challenge one far away one far away good natural language people kind really invested think lot see thats core ai understand really help human communication understand something human mind semantics come human mind agree think long time didnt career cause kind behind early days didnt kind know enough stuff mit didnt learn much language late point kind spend whole career admire field little way learning language know kind part brain trained jan right truly miles davis machine learning dont think theres better place mike huge honor talking today merci beaucoup right pleasure thanks listening conversation michael jordan thank presenting sponsor cash app download use code lexpodcast youll get 10 10 go first organization inspires educates young minds become science technology innovators tomorrow enjoy podcast subscribe youtube give five stars apple podcast support patreon simply connect twitter lex friedman let leave words wisdom michael jordan blog post titled artificial intelligence revolution hasnt happened yet calling broadening scope ai field embrace fact witnessing creation new branch engineering term engineering often invoked narrow sense academia beyond overtones cold effectless machinery negative connotations loss control humans engineering discipline want current era real opportunity conceive something historically new human centric engineering discipline resist giving emerging discipline name acronym ai continues used lets aware real limitations placeholder lets broaden scope tone hype recognize serious challenges ahead thank listening hope see next time say interesting disagreement jan lacune jans old friend say dont think disagree much really kind lets build kind mentality work kind mentality kind concrete speak french speak french together lot common one wanted highlight disagreement really fundamental one think kind emphasizing jan emphasized pattern recognition emphasized prediction interesting try take far could perfect prediction would give kind thought experiment think thats way limited cannot perfect prediction never data sets allow figure youre ready question youre going ask next clue never know things moreover us find day kinds situations anticipation kind novel various ways moment want think want also theres going market forces acting us id like go street full theres crane street got got think got think might really want got sort think much costs action versus action got think risks involved lot current pattern recognition prediction systems dont risk evaluations error bars right got think peoples decisions around got think collection decisions even thinking like medical treatment know im going take prediction neural net health something consequential im ready heart attack number 07 even data world ever collected heart attacks better doctor ever im going trust output neural net predict heart attack im going want ask questions around im going want look us possible data didnt causal things im going want dialogue doctor things didnt think gathered data know could go hope see dont think say predictions everything youre missing stuff prediction plus decision making everything equally important field emphasized prediction jan rightly seen powerful cost people aware decision making rubber really hits road human lives stake risks taken got gather data got think error bars got think consequences decisions others got think economy around decisions blah blah blah blah im one working smaller tribe right one people talk know go real world industry know amazon id say half people working decision making half know pattern recognition important words pattern recognition prediction think distinction linger words distinction constrained sort lab data set versus decision making talking consequential decisions real world messiness uncertainty real world whole whole mess actually touches human beings scale forces thats distinction helps add perspective broader perspective youre right totally agree hand youre real prediction person course want real world want predict real world events im saying thats possible data sets context know strategic things someones data might gather things could gathered reasoning process around data taking data making predictions based data one things youre working im sure theres others working dont hear often talked especially clarity talk think exciting concerning area ai terms decision making youve talked ai systems help make decisions scale distributed way millions billions decisions sort markets decisions starting point sort give example system think youre thinking kinds systems yeah first youre absolutely getting territory beyond expertise lots things going obvious think like like think history little bit think put back sixties kind banking system wasnt computerized really database theory emerging database people think actually move data around actual money know valid transactions atms happen actually know valid forth thats kind issues get start get serious sorts things like like think kind almost thought experiment help think something simpler music market first order music market world right country sure something called things called record companies make money prop really good musicians make superstars make huge amounts money theres long tail huge numbers people make lots lots really good music actually listened people famous people market cannot career make money creators creators creators called influencers whatever diminishes people make extremely good music especially hip hop latin world days laptop thats weekend another job week put soundcloud sites eventually gets streamed gets turned bits economically valuable information lost gets put people stream walk around big city see people headphones especially young kids listening music time look data little music listening famous peoples music none old music latest stuff people made latest stuff like 16 year old somewhere never make career never make money course counter examples record companies incentivize pick highlight long story short theres missing market consumer producer relationship level actual creative acts pipelines spotifys world take stuff stream along make money subscriptions advertising things theyre making money right offer bits pieces people highlight simulate market anyway real market would youre creator music actually somebody whos good enough people want listen data available dashboard showing map united states last week heres places songs listened transparent vetable someone providence sees youre listened 10000 times providence know thats real data know real data come give show broadcast people whove listening youre coming right could go make 20000 three times year start career sense ai creates jobs taking away human jobs creating new jobs creates new market youve created market youve connected producers consumers person whos making music say someone comes shows lot hey ill play daughters wedding 10000 youll say 8000 theyll say 9000 get income 100000 youre going millionaire even think really value music personal connections even much young kid wants wear tshirt favorite musicians signature listen music internet internet able provide button push merchandise arrives next day well kid bought shirt happy person made music get money theres advertising needed create markets producers consumers take 5 cut company perfectly sound itll go forward future create new markets raises human happiness seems like well easy create dashboard kind create connections think uber whatever think challenges real world things like actually new principles going needed youre trying create new kind two way market different scale thats ever done theres going unwanted aspects market therell bad people therell data get used wrong ways itll fail ways wont deliver think like anyone ran big auction ran big matching service economics think things maybe doesnt get huge issues arise start create markets starts least solidify thoughts allow move forward thinking yeah talked head research spotify actually think longterm goal theyve said least one million creators make comfortable living putting spotify think articulate really nice vision world digital cyberspace markets think companies like spotify youtube netflix create markets ai problem interface problem interface design kind economics problem hire solve problems well part top silicon valley attitude know create system like google search box good theyll everyone adopt everything said really think missing kind culture literally 16 year old whos able create songs dont create silicon valley entity dont hire per se create ecosystem wanted belong cultural credibility things like netflix credit wanted credibility created shows content call content terrible word culture movies kind go give large sum money somebody graduating usc film school whole thing kind like rich white peoples thing american culture much rich white people immigrants africans came brought culture rhythms world created whole new thing american culture companies cant artificially create cant say hey going buy youve got partner anyway denigrate companies trying im sure theyre asking questions even making effort partly respect culture technology person youve got blend technology cultural meaning much role think algorithm machine learning connecting consumer creator sort recommender system aspect yeah great question think pretty high theres magic algorithms good recommender system way better bad recommender system recommender systems billion dollar industry back even 10 20 years ago continues extremely important going forward whats favorite recommender system put something well historically one first went amazon first didnt like amazon put book people business library local booksellers went business ive come accept probably books sold poor people reading ever local book stores coming back thats economics sometimes work go go anyway finally started going bought books really pleased see another books recommended never would thought bought bunch obviously good business model learned things still day kind browse using service think lots people get lot good aspect recommendation system im learning peers indirect way algorithms meant impose learn really trying find whats data doesnt work well kinds entities thats complexity human life like shirts im going get recommendations shirts thats interesting try recommend restaurants hard hard scale blend recommendation systems economic ideas matchings really really still open research wise theres new companies going emerge well think going messy difficult land say politics things like youtube twitter deal terms recommendation systems able suggest think facebook launched facebook news recommend kind news likely interesting think ai solvable whatever term want use think solvable problem machines deeply human problem thats unsolvable dont even think level think whats broken companies monetization advertising theyre least facebook want critique didnt really try connect producer consumer economic way right one wants pay anything know starting google facebook went back playbook know television companies back day one wanted pay signal pay tv box signal least back day advertising kind filled gap advertising new interesting somehow didnt take lives quite right fast forward google provides service people dont want pay somewhat surprisingly nineties made ended making huge amounts cornered advertising market didnt seem like going happen least little things right hand side screen seem economically interesting companies maybe choice tv market going away billboards theyve got think sadly google well making money didnt think much wait minute producer consumer relationship set us advertisers market created actual market producer consumer theyre producers person created video clip person made website person could make things person could adjust function demand person side whos asking different kinds things know see glimmers theres influencers theres kind little glimmering market done 20 years ago thought created parallel advertising ecosystem facebook inherited think also didnt think much fast forward making huge amounts money advertising news thing clicks feeding advertising connected advertiser want people click certain things money flows facebook youre much incentivized start find breaking people telling well getting troubles try adjust smart ai algorithms right figure bad clicks maybe shouldnt click rate something else find pretty much hopeless get complexity human life try fix could also fix whole business model business model really human producers consumers economic value liberated connecting directly valuable people able pay right micro payments like small payments micro even micro like example suppose im going next week im going india never india right couple days mumbai idea right could go web right search going kind hopeless im going find know lots advertisers face right really want broadcast world going mumbai someone side market look theres recommendation system im looking possible people coming mumbai theyre looking people relevant someone age group someone kind knows level give little privacy im happy im going get back person make little video theyre going write little two page paper heres cool things want move week especially right im going look im going pay micro payment im going pay know hundred dollars whatever real value like journalism um honest subscription im going pay person moment companys going take 5 person got gig economy know done know thinking little bit behind youtube actually people could make things connected market would make things independently dont tell dont incentivize way um yeah companies dont think thought long hard distinguish facebook one side thought things think uh thinking ai fix everything uh amazon thinks time already real world delivering packages peoples doors worried market worried sellers know worry things great things maybe great know theyre business model id say google sort hovers somewhere dont dont think long long time got think probably see youtube pregnant possibility mightve thought theyre probably heading direction um uh know silicon valley dominated google facebook kind mentality subscription advertising thats core problem right fake news actually rides top means youre monetizing clip rate core problem got remove advertisement going linger mean thats interesting thesis dont know everyone really deeply thinks youre right thought advertising model thing thing well ever fix build algorithms despite business model know find better angels nature good society individual think slowly think first theres difference could youre saying slowly move away advertising model direct connection consumer creator question also advertising model successful terms making huge amount money therefore able build big company provides really smart people working create good service think possible clarify think move away well think yeah know society yeah well companies mean first full disclosure im day week amazon kind want learn things know im speaking amazon way know go actually believe get little bit trying create markets dont really use advertising crucial part well thats good question become crucial become present go amazon website know without revealing many deep secrets amazon tell know lot people company question theres huge questioning going want world theres zero advertising actually bad world okay heres way think youre company like amazon trying bring products customers right customer given moment want buy vacuum cleaner say want know whats available know going obvious little bit work recommendation system sort help right suppose person made world know spent huge amount energy great idea made great vacuum cleaner know really nailed mit know whiz kid made great new vacuum cleaner right going recommendation system one know algorithms find ai fix okay right allow vacuum cleaner start get front people sold well advertising advertising signal youre believe product enough youre willing pay real money consumer look signal say well first know cheap little ads cause right know know super cheap know pennies see ad actually know company theyre making know real money kind flowing see ad may pay attention actually might want see hey guy spent money vacuum cleaner maybe theres something good look thats part overall information flow good market advertising role problem course signal completely gone know dominant tiny little things add big money company know think think change societies dont know stick things annoy lot people advertising currently annoys people provides information think google probably smart enough figure dead bad model even though hard huge amount money theyll figure pull away slowly im sure ceo figure need needed reduce advertising zero reduce time bring producer consumer actual real value delivered real money paid take 5 cut 5 could start get big enough cancel lost revenue kind poor kind advertising think good company realize facebook know god bless bring know grandmothers bring childrens pictures grandmothers lives fantastic need think new business model thats core problem start connect producer consumer think continue make money buy next social network company buy next one innovation level high health issues go away apologize kind returned words dont think exact terms matter sort defense advertisement dont think kind direct connection consumer creator producer advertisement strives right best advertisement literally facebook listening conversation heard youre going india able actually start automatically making connections start giving offer like apologize matter terms draw distinction possible make advertisements better better better algorithmically actually becomes connection almost direct connection thats good question lets component first talked defending advertising okay defending way get signals market dont come way especially algorithmically sign someone spent money sign think valuable think things someone else thinks valuable trust people might willing listen dont trust facebook though whos intermediary dont think care okay dont think find creepy know im going india next week conversation think could put pr hat think find facebook creepy trust majority population theyre silicon valley companies saw like approval rate theres ranking much people trust companies facebook gutter gutter including people inside facebook attribute come dont find creepy right talking might walk street right unknown person dont know kind comes says hear youre going india mean thats even facebook thats want transparency human society want know something theres actually reason know something thats something look later audit kind approve know something care way theres caring relationship even economic one something youre someone could exploit ways dont know care im troubled whatever world right happens way much facebook knows things lot people could exploit exploit times think people find creepy facebook care real sense shouldnt big brother caring us role company like wait big brother part caring trusting mean dont companies link lot companies lot information us would argue theres companies like microsoft information us facebook yet trust microsoft well microsoft pivoting microsoft know satya nadella decided really important dont want creepy things really want people trust us actually use information ways really would approve dont decide right im kind adding health market connect someone produces consumer random producer consumer people see dont like sense transact happiness go sides company helps moments choose choosing fine also think difference know browsing versus buying right moments life want buy know gadget something need something moment need ammonia house something got problem spill want go dont want advertised moment dont want led various know thats annoying want go extremely easy want moments might say like today im going shopping mall want walk around see things see people exposed stuff want control though dont want companys algorithms decide right think thats thing theres total loss control facebook thinks take control us deciding want certain kinds information dont information much relates know us didnt really want know us dont want helping way dont want helping decide control want totally agree facebook way optimistic thing think facebook kind personal information us could create beautiful thing im really optimistic facebook could could dont see think optimism misplaced theres bit business model behind things create beautiful thing really lets lets clear something people would value dont think business model dont think suddenly discover know long hot shower disagree disagree terms discover lot amazing things shower didnt say said wont come wont shower think lot people discover think guy also full disclosure theres company called united masters im board theyve created music market hundred thousand artists signed theyve done things like gone nba nba music find behind nba clips right music right thats company right business model mind get go right executed day one value brought kid made songs suddenly songs nba website right thats real economic value people know differ optimism able sort change direction titanic right yeah im older ive seen titanics crash got elaborate cause totally agree want know difficult think problem example want read news would theres lot times day something makes either smile think way like consciously think really gave value like sometimes listen daily podcasts new york times way better new york times way people listening thats like real journalism happening reason podcast space doesnt make sense often listen 20 minutes would willing pay like 5 10 experience difficult thats kind youre getting little transaction difficult create frictionless system like uber example things whats intuition first pay little bits money know send theres something called courts financial things like medium site dont pay would great post medium would loved pay dollar others wouldnt wanted per se also sites thats actually goal goal actually broadcast channel monetize way chose mean could people know could im thats fine also musicians making music dont think right model pay little subscription fee right people copy bits easily somewhere value value connection made real human beings follow right create yet value think theres lot open questions hot open questions also yeah want good recommendation systems recommend cool stuff pretty hard right dont like recommend stuff based browsing history dont like based stuff know quote unquote whats unknown interesting really interesting question may disagree maybe think love recommender systems want give everything way trust yeah dont example morning clicked know pretty sleepy morning clicked story queen england yes right give damn queen england really clickbait kind looked funny say heck talking dont want life know heading direction thats browsing history system reasonable system think care queen england thats browsing history right youre saying trace digital exhaust whatever thats kind models collect stuff youre going figure us well youre trying figure like kind one person like trump something maybe could figure youre trying figure know 500 million people know way way think think think humans amazingly rich complicated every one us little quirks every one us little things could intrigue us dont even know intrigue us theres sign past god comes know fall love dont want company trying figure anticipate want provide forum market place kind go hook crook happens know im walking street hear chilean music played never knew liked chilean music wow side want provide limited know interesting place go right dont try use ai kind know figure put world figured know create huge spaces human beings creativity style enriched come forward itll lot transparency wont people randomly anonymously putting comments ill special based stuff know facts know broken right youre know especially youre celebrity know anybody anonymous people hurting lots lots people right thats part thing silicon valley thinking know collect information use great way im im pessimist im much optimist nature think thats wrong path whole technology take limited create let humans rise dont try replace thats ai mantra dont try anticipate dont try predict youre youre youre going youre going able things youre going make things worse okay right give chance right recommender systems creepy people shadow watching every move theyre looking traces theyre directly interacting sort close friends family way know conversation actually interactions back forth think theres place recommender systems sort step cause emphasize value human human connection yeah give chance ai human connection role ai system conversations terms try figure kind music like watching listening actually conversation natural language otherwise yeah im im im wanted push back maybe youre saying options facebook think misplaced think distributing yeah good go thats hard spot yeah good human interaction like daily context around home something dont want big company know would happy technology help kind technology well know alexa amazon well good alexas done right think alexa research platform right anything else alexa done right know could things like leave water running garden say hey alexa waters running garden even alexa figure means wife comes home told thats little bit reasoning would call ai kind stretch little bit reasoning actually kind would make life little easier better know dont wouldnt call wow moment kind think overall rises human happiness kind thing youre lonely alexa knowing loneliness dont want alexa feel intrusive dont want designer system kind work really want lot control want transparency control company stand give context new technology think theyre good first way successful current generation like said mentioning microsoft really think theyre theyre pivoting kind trusted old uncle know think get way go let people find technology empowers control control privacy rich set interactions people going like lot thats thats right business model going forward control privacy look like think able view data much mean first individual decision people dont want privacy want whole life peoples want privacy zero one legal thing data available like recall people know couple hundred years ago everyone really big cities everyone lived countryside villages villages everybody knew everything didnt privacy bad better well know arguably get loss certain kinds privacy well people help know everything know somethings bads happening help right live big city one knows get help kind depends answer want certain people trust relationships kind manage knows agency shouldnt shouldnt drift sea technology agency dont want go reading things checking boxes dont know im privacy researcher per se recognize vast complexity technology legal scholars meeting technologists theres gotta kind whole layers around alluded emerging engineering field big part electrical engineering came im one around time didnt plug electricity walls kinds work dont like underwriters laboratory reassured plugs going burn house machine everything therell whole people install things therell people watch installers therell whole layers know onion kinds things things deep interesting privacy least interesting electricity thats going take decades kind work going require lot new structures dont right kind hard talk youre saying theres lot money made get right something look lot money made things provide human services people recognize useful parts lives yeah yeah dialogue sometimes goes exuberant technologists technology good kind thats know public discourse know far see much kind thing sober discussions middle challenge wants need conversations know theres actually theres many forum fora know theres thats thats kind would look maybe could go could read comment section something would actually kind dialogue going back forth dont see much right actually theres resurgence podcasts people really hungry conversation theres technology helping much comment sections anything including youtube hurting helping\",\n          \"becoming cyborgs brains fundamentally changed everyone grew electronics fundamentally different previous homo sapiens call us homo techno think evolved homo techno like essentially new species previous technologies mean may even profound moved us certain degree think computers make us homo techno think brain augmentation like allows actual evolution like computers accelerate degree technologies also accelerated would classify homo sapien homo techno definitely homo techno youre one earliest species think us following conversation grimes artist musician songwriter producer director fascinating human thinks lot history future human civilization studying dark periods past help form optimistic vision future lex friedman podcast support please check sponsors description dear friends heres grimes oh yeah cloud lifter go go know stuff ever used cloud lifter yeah actually microphone cloud lifter michael jackson used really yeah like thriller stuff mic cloud lifter yeah incredible microphone flattering vocals ive used lot great demo vocals great room sometimes easier record vocals youre room musics playing wanna feel headphones mic pretty directional think good mic vibing getting real good vocal take vibing room anyway michael jackson quincy jones microphone feel way badass right wanna get guess right one names least space time c like letter c told c means lot things speed light render rate universe yes spanish crescent moon happens favorite programming language basically runs world also powerful fast dangerous mess things really bad pointers anyway associations name c coolest mean coolest speed light obviously speed light say render rate universe think mean speed light essentially thats rendering see think well know simulation speed light changes improve render speed well already pretty good already pretty good improves well know probably like okay theyve updated upgraded well fast enough us humans seems immediate theres delay theres latency terms us humans earth interacting things youre like intergalactic species operating much larger scale youre gonna start noticing weird stuff operate like around black hole youre gonna start see render issues cant go faster speed light correct really limits ability ones ability travel space theoretically wormholes theres nothing general relativity precludes faster speed light travel seems youre gonna really funky stuff heavy things like weirdnesses basically terrors space time dont know navigators know navigators yeah folding space basically making wormholes name c yes think multiple people one person know like morning different person tonight say recording basically midnight awesome yes thank much think im eight hours late youre right time good morning beginning new day soon anyway person morning evening multiple people think one person maybe clue giant mystery okay really intense questions lets go lets go asked like look mirror people tell even mean mean think personality changes everyone talk inconsistent personality yeah person person interaction personality materializes mood like ill go like megalomaniac like know like total hermit shy combinatorial combination mood person youre interacting yeah mood people im interacting think everyones like maybe well everybody acknowledges able introspect brings kind person kind mood brings best artist human introspect like best friends like people im like super confident know theyre gonna understand everything im saying like best friends start really funny thats always like peak mode like yeah takes lot get lets talk constraints youve talked constraints limits help artist human get way like constraints creating music creating art living life like constraints world puts hate constraints moving youre good right like like progressing technology changing constraints like artistic creation know making video music stuff getting lot cheaper theres constantly new technology new software thats making faster easier much freedom 70s like michael jackson know recorded thriller microphone like use mixing desk stuff like probably even get studio probably really expensive really good singer know use like mixing desk everything know make ive made whole album computer lot freedom im also constrained different ways theres like literally millions artists like much bigger playing field like also didnt learn music im natural musician dont know anything actual music know like computer im really kind like messing around like trying things well yeah mean nature music changing youre saying dont know actual music music changing music becoming youve talked becoming like merging technology yes becoming something like notes piano becoming weird composition requires engineering skills programming skills kind human robot interaction skills still things michael jackson like good ear good sense taste whats good final thing put together like youre allowed youre enabled empowered laptop layer stuff start like layering insane amounts stuff super easy think music production really underrated art form feel like people really dont appreciate look publishing splits way people like pay producers stuff super producers deeply underrated like many songs popular right last 20 years like part reason theyre popular production really interesting really sick really cool like dont think listeners like people dont really understand music production sort like weird discombobulated art form like formal new isnt like formal training path mostly driven like autodidacts like like almost everyone know whos good production like didnt go music school anything taught theyre mostly different like music producers know commonalities time together different kinds weirdos cause hung rick rubin dont know youve yeah mean rick rubin like literally one gods music production like hes one people first know like made music production know made production important actual lyrics notes thing interesting dont know speak hanging seems sit silence close eyes listen like almost nothing nothing somehow gives freedom best version thats music production somehow like encouraging less simplify like push towards minimalism mean guess mean work differently rick rubin cause rick rubin produces artists whereas like mostly produce different situation also think rick rubin hes would say advanced category producer like youve like earned engineer stuff people like stuff usually like stuff youre engineer producer artist yeah guess would say im era like post rick rubin era like come kind like skrillex school thought like yeah engineer producer artist like mean lately sometimes ill work producer im gently sort delicately starting collaborate bit like think im kind like whatever 2010s explosion things everything became available computer kind got like lone wizard energy thing going embraced loneliness loneliness somehow engine creativity like stuff creative quote unquote genius quotes privacy mind yes well heres thing talking daniel eck said hes like artists 10 years like 10 good years usually stop making like vital shit feel like im sort like nearing end 10 years become somebody else im like im process becoming somebody else reinventing work people ive never worked people find make like im exceptionally rejuvenated making like vital work ive ever made think another human brain like one best tools possibly find like funny way put love like tool like know whatever hp plus one like adds like stats character like another human brain like square instead like adding something double experience points love also mention playing tavern music love first think first stop tavern music yeah doesnt audio okay okay makes yeah itll make podcast annoying add post add post one want listen podcast probably would makes reminds like video game like role playing video game experience points theres something really joyful wandering places like elder scrolls like skyrim exploring landscapes another world get experience points work different skills somehow progress life dont know simple doesnt messy complexities life theres usually bad guy fight skyrim dragons im sure elden ring theres bunch monsters fight love feel like elden ring feel like good analogy music production though like feel like engineers people creating open worlds sort like similar people music producers like hidden archetype like one really understands one really knows theyre like like artist engineer like art fairly complex engineering well youre saying dont get enough credit arent kind changing becoming person everything arent isnt engineer well mean others gone im know theres like timbaland skrillex theres people like know famous think general think people get confused dont really know per se see song like theres like hit song like im trying think like going like even basic pop hit like whats like rules dua lipa something production actually like really crazy mean song also great like production exceptionally memorable like know like one cant dont even know produced song like isnt part like rhetoric discuss creation art sort like dont consider music producer think music producer used simply recording things yeah thats interesting think movies talk actor actresses also talk directors dont talk like music often beatles music producer one first kind guy one first people sort introducing crazy sound design pop music forget name forget name know like weird stuff like dropping pianos like yeah oh get yeah yeah yeah get sound get authentic sound lyrics think fit important heartbroken learn elvis didnt write songs mad lot people dont write songs understand heres thing feel like theres desire authenticity used like really mad like people wouldnt write produce music id like thats fake realized theres like weird bitterness like agronus art authenticity kind like weird realization recently started thinking like art sort decentralized collective thing like art kind conversation artists ever lived know like like youre really sort like anyones reinventing wheel like youre kind taking know thousands years art like running little algorithm like making interpretation joined conversation artists came beautiful way look like like feel like everyones always like theres copyright ip authenticity like think need stop seeing like egotistical thing like oh creative genius lone creative genius like think art shouldnt think art something sort brings humanity together also art also kind collective memory humans like dont give fuck whatever ancient egypt like much grain got sent day sending records like know like went know many shields needed produced like remember art like know like day day life theres stuff seems important art helps us function survive gone like thing thats really gonna left art technology obsolete thats fascinating like humans dead true good compression human history art weve generated across different centuries different millennia aliens come aliens come theyre gonna find hieroglyphics pyramids mean art could broadly defined might find like engineering marvels bridges rockets guess sort classify though architecture art consider engineering formats art sure sucks like digital art easier delete theres apocalypse nuclear war disappear yes physical theres something still valuable physical manifestation art sucks like music example played somebody yeah think foundation type situation like know like seed banks north stuff like probably like solar powered geothermal little bunker like human knowledge mentioned daniel ek spotify think artist whats spotify empowering spotify consumer super exciting makes easy access music kinds artists get explore kinds music make super easy sort curate playlist fun liberating let go know used collect know albums cds like horde albums yeah like matter reality could know really liberating could let go letting go albums youre kind collecting allows find new music exploring new artists kind stuff know perspective artist could like mentioned competition could kind constraint theres artists platform think better

whats exciting history way thinking history think dan carlin one people like dan carlin one people really started getting excited like revolutionizing education like dan carlin instilled already like really liked history instilled like obsessive love history point like im fucking reading like going bed reading like part four rise fall third reich whatever like got like dense ass history like like opened door like made want scholar topic like like feel like hes good teacher like know sort made feel like one things could education like find like worlds great teachers like create passion topic autodidactricism dont know say properly like self teaching like much faster lectured like much efficient sort like able teach ask teacher questions dont know whats like know thats like university stuff like learn much material much faster youre lot learning youre going teachers get stuck like teachers inspire passion topic think one invaluable skills whole species like like ai like ai going teach much efficiently teach needed get point teach finds motivation right yeah like inspire yeah could teach make fact mentioned rise fall third reich read yeah read twice read twice yes okay one even knows yeah im like wait thought like super poppin book super pop yeah im like im far interesting yeah written person important kind know start like could possibly happen read rise fall third reich like people tried really hard happen people tried almost reinstated monarchy one point try stop happening like almost like abandoned democracy try get happen least way makes feel theres bunch small moments history turn yes like small meetings yes human interactions terrifying inspiring like even attempts assassinating hitler like time time failed close like operation valkyrie good theres also role thats really heavy burden geopolitical perspective role leaders see evil truly becomes evil anticipate stand evil evil actually pretty rare world scale hitler tend know modern discourse kind call people evil quickly look ancient history like ton hitlers actually think norm like going back like sort intelligent design theory think one things weve successfully slow move survival fittest intelligent design weve kind eradicating like look like ancient assyria stuff like shit like brutal like heads like brutal like genghis khan like genocide genocide like throwing plague bodies walls decimating whole cities like muslim conquests like damascus shit like people cities used get leveled fucking time okay get bronze age collapse basically like almost like roman level like society like like world like global trade like everything awesome mix think bit climate change development iron basically bronze could come way make bronze like everything funneled one iranian mine like one supply chain one things makes worried supply chains think need thoughtful think biggest issue society right like thing likely go wrong probably supply chain collapse war climate change whatever like anything causes supply chain collapse population big handle like thing seems cause dark ages mass supply chain collapse bronze age collapse happened like sort like ancient collapse happened like literally like ancient egypt cities everything got like decimated destroyed abandoned cities like hundreds like flourishing society like almost coming modernity everything got leveled mini dark ages like theres little writing recording time like isnt lot information bronze age collapse basically equivalent like medieval medieval dark ages happened dont know years like thousands years earlier sort like recovered bronze age collapse empire reemerged writing trade everything reemerged course contemporary dark ages time weve designed mechanism lessen lessen capability destructive power centers emerge theres recording contemporary dark ages think like better understanding avoid still think high risk think thats one big risks right natural state humans lot hitlers gotten really good making hard emerge weve gotten better collaboration resisting power like authoritarians come power trying go country country like moving past kind like slowly incrementally like moving towards like scary old school war stuff think seeing happen countries least nominally like supposed moved past thats scary reminds us happen like places moved supposedly hopefully moved past possibly civilization level like said supply chain collapse might make people resource constraint might make people desperate angry hateful violent drag us right back mean supply chain collapse like ultimate thing caused middle ages supply chain collapse like people people reliant certain level technology like people like look like britain like glass like people aqueducts people like indoor heating cooling like running water like buy food world trade markets like people didnt know hunt forage gather similar situation educated enough survive without technology supply chain collapse like limits access technology like massive starvation violence displacement war like know like yeah opinion like primary marker like dark age well technology kind enabling us resilient terms supply chain terms different catastrophic events happened us although pandemic kind challenged preparedness catastrophic think coolest invention humans come wheel fire cooking meat computers computers freaking computers internet computers one think previous technologies mean may even profound moved us certain degree think computers make us homo tech think brain augmentation like allows actual evolution like computers accelerate degree technologies also accelerated would classify homo sapien homo techno definitely homo techno youre one earliest species think us like said like think like looked brain scans us versus humans hundred years ago would look different think physiologically different even interaction devices changed brains well look lot studies coming show like theres degree inherited memory physiological changes theory passing like thats know thats like instance physiological change thats gonna fizzle theory progress like offspring speaking offspring advice would give young person like high school whether artist creative engineer kind career path maybe life general live life proud think one big thoughts like especially kids dont think spend enough time teaching creativity think creativity muscle like things theres lot emphasis know learn play piano write song like learn technical stuff thing think like friend whos like worlds greatest guitar player like know amazing sort like producer works people hes really sort like know like engineers records things like solos doesnt really like make music talking like dude youre talented music like dont make music whatever like cause got im old never learned creative muscle like know embarrassing like learning creative muscle takes lot failure also sort youre creative know youre throwing paint wall lot stuff fail like part like tolerance failure humiliation thats somehow thats easier develop youre young persist youre young everything easier develop youre young yes younger better could destroy mean thats shitty thing creativity know failure could destroy youre careful thats risk worth taking also young age developing tolerance failure good fail time like stupid shit time like public private get canceled ive make kinds mistakes like resilient making mistakes like lot things like people wouldnt like think greatest asset creativity like think pain like tolerance failure super essential thing taught things brilliant advice yeah yeah wish everybody encouraged sort failure opposed kind cause like punish failure like like teaching kids like thats wrong like thats know like x keeps like like wrong know met came furious spotify like grilled super hard ive got answers saying like sort peak cd industry like 20000 artists making millions millions dollars like like tiny kind 1 spotify kind democratized industry think said theres million artists making good living spotify heard like honestly would rather make less money like decent living artists able even though like wish could include everyone yeah thats really hard argue youtube youtubes mission want basically many creators possible make living kind living thats hard argue hard think theres better ways manager actually wish like would brought manager building app manage itll like help organize percentages get publishing dah dah dah dah dah take middlemen much bigger itll like automate get automate manager automate management publishing legal read app hes building read contract like tell one issues music right getting paid enough art industry filled middlemen artists good business beginning like frank sinatra mob stuff like music industry run business people artists artists really get small cuts like make think part reason im technocrat mean fans gonna technocrats ones theyre gonna mad like fans hate say kind thing general public dont like technocrats dont like technocrats like watched battle angel alita like martian technocracy like yeah martian technocracy like theyre evil like oh okay like cause martian technocracy sounds sick yeah intuition technocrats would create kind beautiful world example managers working create app removes need lawyer could smart contracts blockchain removes need like management organizing stuff like read stuff explain collect royalties know like small amounts amount money youre getting spotify actually means lot goes lot farther remove bureaucracy inefficiencies make life great could yeah think issue isnt theres enough like issue theres inefficiency im really positive sum mindset know win win mindset like instead know fighting scraps make worrying scarcity like instead scarcity mindset dont increase efficiency know way expand size pie let ask experimentation said beautiful musician like conversation came much creating music like kind conversation trying fit cultural trends much like trying much possible outsider come something totally new like youre thinking youre experimenting trying totally different totally weird trying fit man hard feel like im kind process semi retiring music like old brain yeah bring like shelf put table couple minutes well poke think bit think forcing engage new music really great neuroplasticity like think know people part reason music marketed young people young people neuroplastic like youre 16 like 23 whatever gonna really easy love new music youre older gets harder harder harder think one beautiful things musician constantly force listen new music think keeps brain really plastic think really good exercise think everyone listen new music hate think keep force like okay well people like like know make brain form new neural pathways open change thats really brilliant actually sorry interrupt like exercise really amazing sort embrace change embrace sort practice neuroplasticity like thats one things fall love certain band kind stay rest life never understand modern music thats really good exercise streaming spotify like classic rock stuff like new music makes small chunk played spotify think like good sign us species think yeah good measure species open mindedness change often listen new music brain lets put music brain back shelf gotta pull futurist brain second wild ways think future say like 30 years maybe 50 years maybe hundred years different current way life earth talk augmented reality virtual reality maybe robots maybe space travel maybe video games maybe genetic engineering keep going cyborgs aliens world wars maybe destructive nuclear wars good bad think future imagining whats weirdest wildest could read surface detail iain banks surface detail favorite depiction oh wow read book literally greatest science fiction book possibly ever written iain banks man yeah sure read player games read titles cant copyrighted steal like player games sick nice yeah name album like always wanted romeo juliet something always wanted name album war peace nice like would like good thats good heard like could also things public domain people clue song called player games yes oh yeah iain banks surface detail opinion best future ive ever read heard science fiction basically theres relationship super intelligence like artificial super intelligence like great want credit person coined term love term feel like young women dont get enough credit yeah go protopia futures instagram name personalized donor experience scale ai power donor experience monica bealskite im saying wrong im probably gonna im probably butchering bit protopia sort utopia unattainable protopia sort like know wow thats awesome instagram protopia futures great future know good get future positive future ai centralized ai surface detail distributed kind ai mostly exist giant super ships like sort like guild ships dune like theyre giant ships kind move people around ships sentient talk passengers mean theres lot different types ai banksyan future opening scene surface detail theres place called culture culture basically protopian future protopian future think like future like obviously utopia perfect like cause like striving utopia think feels hopeless sort like maybe best terminology using like pretty good place like mostly like know super intelligence biological beings exist fairly harmony theres much war theres like close equality get know like approximately good future like theres really awesome stuff opening scene girl shes born sex slave outside culture shes society doesnt adhere cultural values tries kill guy like master kills unbeknownst traveling ship culture like hell say like crazy things like x keeps like like bubble car bubble car im like know im like whats bubble car like like doesnt like dont want like youre wrong im like youre thinking weird crazy shit like dont know bubble car like creating worlds might internally consistent might discover something fundamental world yeah hell like rewrite songs like words prefers like instead baby shark says baby car like maybe hes onto something let ask big ridiculous question kind dancing around think meaning whole thing human civilization life earth general life whats meaning life c read nova scene yet james lovelock youre lot really good book recommendations havent even finished im huge fraud yet like really early book says amazing thing like feel like everyones sad cynical like everyones like fermi paradox everyone keep hearing people like fuck alone like oh ah like ah ah im like okay like wait beginning like nova scene says gonna correct cant like memorize quotes says something like consciousness like right like universe waking like instead discovering universe universe like evolution literal universe like separate universe like universe waking universe seeing first time like universe becoming conscious first time part yeah cause like arent separate universe like could like incredibly sacred moment maybe like social media things stuff getting connected together like maybe neurons connecting like collective super intelligence waking yeah like know like maybe instead something cynical maybe theres something discover like maybe know blast assist like incredible kind consciousness like first three years life human children well forget suffering going think well probably forget mean probably know artificial intelligence eventually render us obsolete dont think theyll malicious way think probably weak sun expanding like dont know like hopefully get mars like pretty vulnerable know like think coexist long time ai also probably make less vulnerable know think consciousness sentience self awareness like think might single greatest like moment evolution ever like maybe know big like true beginning life blue green algae like single celled organisms something amazing universe awakens yeah well see youre incredible person youre fascinating mind definitely friend liv mentioned guys thinking maybe talking would love explored mind kind media podcast kind way youre awesome person honor know honor get sit late night like surreal really enjoyed thank talking today yeah mean huge honor feel underqualified im big fan ive listening podcast lot yeah liv would appreciate advice help definitely gonna yeah anytime thank cool thank thanks listening conversation grimes support podcast please check sponsors description let leave words oscar wilde yes im dreamer dreamer one find way moonlight punishment sees dawn rest world thank listening hope see next time one day ship put neural lace head neural lace sort like basically neuralink life imitates art indeed indeed wakes opening scene memory uploaded neural lace killed gets choose new body ai interfacing recorded memory neural lace helping like hello youre dead neural lace memorys uploaded want choose new body youre going born culture like start new life thats like opening like sick ship super intelligence ships kind super intelligence still want preserve kind rich fulfilling experience humans yeah like theyre like friends humans theres bunch ships dont want exist biological beings place like way dont thing theyre necessarily pretty protopian existence pretty peaceful yeah mean example one main fights book theyre fighting theres artificial hells people dont think ethical artificial hell like basically people crime get sent like die memory gets sent artificial hell theyre eternally tortured way society deciding whether artificial hell theyre simulated theyre like simulated war instead actual blood know people basically essentially fighting video game choose outcome theyre still experiencing suffering artificial hell experience stuff artificial hell sucks lot people culture want get rid artificial hell theres simulated wars happening artificial hell simulated wars happening outside artificial hell political factions political faction says simulated hell deter crime political faction saying simulated hell unethical instead like know blowing nukes theyre like giant fortnite battle decide know thats protopia thats like okay war without death know dont think simulated hells think definitely one ways technology could go wrong almost punishing people digital space something like yeah like torturing peoples memories either deterrent like committed crime also personal pleasure theres sick demented humans world dan carlin actually episode hardcore history painful attainment oh episode fucked dark kind goes human history says like humans seem enjoy secretly enjoy used openly enjoy sort torture death watching death torture humans think people consenting allowed gladiatorial matches consent hard achieve situations always starts getting slippery like could also forced consent like starts getting weird theres way much excitement like highlights theres something human nature wants see violence really dark hope sort overcome aspect human nature thats still within us somewhere well think thats right theory important current moment evolution survival fittest point lines kind fuzzy recent past maybe even right getting point choose intelligent design like probably since like integration iphone like becoming cyborgs like brains fundamentally changed everyone grew electronics fundamentally different previous homo sapiens call us homo techno think evolved homo techno like essentially new species like look way took mri brain took mri like medieval brain think would different way evolved think historians look back time theyll see like fundamental shift human think think still homo sapiens believe homo techno think evolved think right way evolving choose think reckless like social media think idea like time choose intelligent design taken seriously like moment reprogram human computer like go blind visual cortex get taken functions choose evolution change way brains work actually huge responsibility think im sure responsible theres definitely adequate education inundated technology fundamentally changing physical structure brains adequately responding choose wanna evolve could evolve could really whatever want think really important time think choose correctly choose wisely consciousness could exist long time integration ai could extremely positive dont think enough people focusing specific situation think might irreversibly screw things get things wrong flip side seems humans pretty adaptive maybe way figure things screwing like social media generation well see negative effects social media build new social medias keep improving stuff learn failures past humans seem really adaptive flip side get wrong way literally create weapons war increase hate past certain threshold really lot damage mean think optimized notice negative things would actually say one things think people arent noticing look silicon valley look technocracy like whats happening silicon valley started facebook profit crap really wasnt particular guess useful sort whatever see lab grown meat compostable biodegradable single use cutlery meditation apps think actually evolving changing technology changing think maybe isnt quite enough education also dont know theres quite enough incentive think way capitalism works define profit also working old model define profit really think changed idea profit include social good economic profit social good also counting profit would incentivize things useful whatever spiritual technology positive technology things help reprogram human computer good way things help us intelligently design new brains yeah theres reason within framework capitalism word profit idea profit cant also incorporate well human like long term well long term happiness even example talking motherhood like part reason im late get baby bed like keep thinking motherhood capitalism like extremely essential job difficult compensated sort like value things much compensate really devalue motherhood society pretty much societies like capitalism recognize motherhood job youre supposed free like feel like producing great humans seen great profit capitalism like thats like huge social good like every awesome human gets made adds much world like integrated profit structure know potentially found way compensate motherhood come compensation thats much broader money could money like made dont know dont know youd pay like mean thats start getting reallocation resources people get upset well like made like motherhood dow yeah yeah know used fund like single mothers like know pay making babies mean create put beautiful things onto world could companies bridges could art could lot things could children education anything valued society somehow incorporated framework market like contribute children world valued respected sort celebrated like proportional thing fuels human civilization yeah like kind important feel like everyones always saying mean think different social spheres everyones always saying like dismantle capitalism im like well okay well dont think government everything like dont think private ownership like thats scary know like starts getting weird stuff sort like feel theres almost way without police state know obviously capitalism major flaws think actually mac showed idea called social capitalism form capitalism like considers social good also profit like know like right companies need like youre supposed grow every quarter whatever like show youre functioning well like okay well kept amount profit youre still green also social good like really need extra economic growth could add social good counts know dont know economist idea could achieved dont think economists know anything could achieved either pretend thing construct model go tv shows sound like expert thats definition economist mother becoming mother change human would say man think kind changed everything still changing lot actually changing right moment like today like like recent months stuff elucidate change like wake morning look become different would say think really reorienting priorities first really fighting somehow felt like failure feminism something like felt like like bad like kids started mattering work like recently started sort analyzing thought like thats also kind construct like weve devalued motherhood much culture like feel guilty caring kids care work feminism includes breaking whatever construct continually breaking like freedom empower free means also like mother like im much creative like cannot believe massive amount brain growth think cause like stakes higher somehow think like trippy watching consciousness emerge like like going crazy journey something like craziest science fiction novel could ever read crazy watching consciousness come time like youre forced value time much like creative time sacred need like really fricking thing used like cynic used wanna like last album called miss anthropocene like like like study villainy like like well instead old gods like new gods like miss anthropocene like misanthrope like anthropocene like know like shes goddess climate change whatever shes like destroying world like like dark like study villainy sort like like used like problem making cynical angry scary art theres anything wrong think kids makes optimist inherently makes wanna optimist bad like feel responsibility make optimistic things get lot shit everyones like oh youre privileged stop talking like pie sky stupid concepts focus like like think dont ideate futures could good wont able get everything blade runner gonna end blade runner like said earlier life imitates art like life really imitate art really need protopian utopian art think incredibly essential future humanity think current discourse thats seen thinking protopia utopia seen dismissal problems currently think incorrect mindset like kids makes wanna imagine amazing futures like maybe wont able build able build want yeah seem like ideation precursor creation imagine order able build sad thing human nature somehow cynical view world seen insightful view know cynicism often confused insight sad see optimism confused naivete yes yes like dont youre blinded maybe privilege whatever youre blinded something youre certainly blinded thats sad thats sad see seems like optimists ones create future theyre ones build order build crazy thing optimistic either stupid excited passionate mad enough actually believe built people built favorite quote time star wars episode 8 know everyone hates like star wars episode 8 yeah probably would say would probably hate yeah dont strong feelings let backtrack dont strong feelings star wars im tolkien person im dragons orcs ogres yeah mean tolkien forever really want one son call thought tao tecno tolkien would cool lot ts like

thats tao tecno tolkien star wars episode 8 know lot people issues personally record think best star wars film youre starting trouble today yeah dont kill hate save love dont kill hate dont kill hate save love think society right diagnosis mode diagnosing diagnosing diagnosing trying kill hate trying save love enough theres buckminster fuller quote im gonna butcher dont remember correctly something along lines dont try destroy old bad models render obsolete better models maybe dont need destroy oil industry maybe create great new battery technology sustainable transport make economically unreasonable still continue rely fossil fuels like dont kill hate save love make new things render old things unusable like college debt bad universities expensive feel like education becoming obsolete feel like could completely revolutionize education could make free like look jstor pay get studies everything created dao bought jstor created dao funding studies studies open source free everyone open sourced education decentralized education made free research internet outcomes studies internet one student debt take tests apply job youre qualified work like dont know anything works im randomly ranting like humility gotta think basic first principles problem whats broken ideas thats get excited ideas share excitement dont tear kill things often end killing like war one sided like youre gonna go kill like youre gonna get stabbed like think talk nexus point point society switching intelligent design think part switch intelligent design need choose nonviolence need like think choose start dont think eradicate violence species think need little bit think choose really reorient primitive brains fighting scarcity attack oriented move optimize creativity building yeah interesting think happens education living life introspecting mind trying live better angels nature one us kinds things scale thats sort start minimize amount destructive war world thats probably youre technology really promising way like social media really promising way way connect know part really enjoy social media know negative stuff dont engage negative stuff even like blocking kind stuff letting enter mind like like somebody says something negative see immediately think positive thoughts forget exist move like negative energy return negative energy theyre going get excited negative way right back kind vicious cycle would think technology would assist us process letting go taking things personally engaging negativity unfortunately social media profits negativity current models mean social media like gun like take course use like like mean like say reprogram human computer like school learn social media optimizes know raise cortisol levels make angry crazy stressed like learn hygiene use social media yeah choose focus negative stuff dont know im sure social media guess exist im sure mean messy experimental phase like working yeah early days dont even know say social media dont know even means early days think social media basic human connection digital realm think exist theres many ways bad way theres many ways good way theres discussions human rights talk freedom speech talk sort violence space digital media talk hate speech talk things figure back day physical space figuring digital space like baby stages printing press came like pure chaos minute know like inject theres massive information injection general population theres gonna feel like printing press dont years like printing press came shit got really fucking bad minute got enlightenment

stuff oh hes like like hell like give treat take away laugh like stuff like hes like chess player heres cognitive sort theres computer programmed hes taking environment interacting specific set humans would first let ask want ask program computer also make sense theres conscious right wasnt giving lot crisis thoughts im thinking really hard think thats part reason like im struggling focus art stuff right cause baby x becoming conscious like reorienting brain like brain suddenly totally shifting like oh shit like way raise children like hate baby books everything hate like theyre oh art bad like stuff everything aesthetics like im like ah like programming languages using program baby computers isnt good yeah like im thinking like good answers know im thinking really really hard recently watched totoro studio ghibli like fantastic film like responded know youre supposed show baby screens much like think sort like feel like highest art baby content like really speaks theres almost talking really simple although dialogue super super super simple know like one three year old like really connect like feels like almost aimed like one three year old like great art imaginative beautiful like first time showed like invested unlike ive ever unlike anything else id ever shown like like crying cry laughing laugh like like roller coaster like emotions like learned bunch words like started saying totoro started saying stuff watching totoro wants watch time like man isnt industry like arent best artists focusing making art like birth consciousness like thats one things ive thinking really wanna start know dont wanna speak things much like im like ages one three like putting much effort thing totoro like like better environment adults love totoro good art everyone loves like still old totoro merch kid like literally ragged old totoro merch like everybody loves everybody keeps like art babies need suck accessible adults thrown know age like like dont know dont like fully formed thought something ive thinking lot like like totoroesque content like content like like universal everybody loves like really geared emerging consciousness emerging consciousness first like three years life much turmoil much evolution mind happening seems like crucial time would say make suck think basically treating child like capacity brilliance adult even beyond think mind cause still like talk weird stuff like respond better cause even imitate better voice higher like people say like oh dont baby talk like voice higher closer something imitate like like baby talk actually

universe isnt information processing happens universe universe know mit colleague seth lloyd feels differently right well youre thinking universe closed system makes computer like pc like computing machine theres human every comes moves mouse around input gives input gives input thats youre saying computation deterministic thing thats unrolling immense complexity nevertheless like processing

performing computation come definitions answer yes useful computation think absolutely helpful think universe certain situations certain contexts information processing device im even guilty writing paper called quantum circuit cosmology modeled whole universe quantum circuit circuit circuit yeah qubits kind thing qubits basically right yeah qubits becoming entangled wanna digress little bit lets kind fun heres mystery universe deep profound nobody talks space expands right talk certain region space certain number degrees freedom certain number ways quantum fields particles region arrange number degrees freedom region space arguably finite actually dont know many theres good argument says finite number universe expands space gets bigger degrees freedom infinite number doesnt really matter infinity times two still infinity finite number theres space theres degrees freedom come would mean universe closed system theres degrees freedom popping existence suggested degrees freedom theyre start theyre entangled start universe know three dimensions around us see said entangled degrees freedom making space time universe expands whole bunch qubits zero state become entangled rest space time action quantum circuits mean theres degrees freedom become entangled yeah universe expands thats right theres degrees freedom entangled playing part playing role part entangled space time structure basic underlying philosophy space time arises entanglement fundamental quantum degrees freedom wow okay point entanglement happening talking close big bang talking throughout time life throughout history yeah idea big bang almost degrees freedom universe could unentangled anything else thats reflection fact big bang low entropy simple small place space expands degrees freedom become entangled rest world well ask john carroll think thought experiment nick bostrom living simulation think let contextualize little bit think people dont actually take thought experiments think quite interesting useful quite interesting perspective ai lot learning done usually happens simulation artificial examples constructive question ask difficult real world simulate right kind dual part living simulation somebody built simulation try hard would obviously could living simulation want physical possibility completely agree physically possible dont think actually take one piece data consideration know live big universe okay theres two trillion galaxies observable universe 200 billion stars galaxy et cetera would seem waste resources universe big going simulation words want good bayesian want ask hypothesis expect see first thing would say wouldnt expect see universe big okay second thing wouldnt expect resolution universe good always possible superhuman simulators finite resources dont render entire universe right part two trillion galaxies isnt actually simulated fully okay obvious extrapolation simulated fully like rest non player characters right im thing real rest chat bots beyond wall see wall literally nothing side wall sort bayesian prediction thats would like efficient simulation like none seems quite realistic dont see hear argument possible easy simulate lots things dont see evidence know universe look like simulated universe maybe say well dont know would look like thats abandoning bayesian responsibilities like job say theory heres would expect see yeah certainly think simulation thing thats like video game small subset rendered say entire laws physics entire closed system quote unquote universe creator yeah always possible right thats useful think youre thinking physics way nick bostrom phrases possible simulate universe eventually well right use way lot things well yeah guess question hard create universe wrote little blog post maybe im missing something theres argument says might possible simulate universe probably imagine actually attribute consciousness agency little things simulating little artificial beings theres probably lot ordinary organic beings universe future right theres argument simulation possible probable space living consciousnesses simulated right top level think argument must wrong follows argument simulated also simulate things well simulate things simulate things right give enough power resolution ultimately well reach bottom laws physics universe bottom made atoms forth cheapest possible simulations believe original argument conclude cheapest possible simulation thats people dont look like doesnt look like edge resolution 16 bit things seems much easier make much lower level things also questioned whole approach anthropic principle says typical observers universe think thats actually think theres lot selection typical within things already know typical within universe think theres intelligent life however would like define intelligent life universe guess intelligent life observable universe us simply basis fact likely number intelligent species observable universe theres two likely numbers zero billions billions would noticed already literally like small number like know star trek theres dozen intelligent civilizations galaxy billion thats weird thats sort bizarre easy imagine zero others theres big bottleneck making multicellular life technological life whatever hard imagine theres whole bunch somehow remained hidden us question id like ask would intelligent life look like mean question going intelligent life big ways different one earth theres kinds intelligent life operates different scales size temporal right thats great possibility think humble intelligence life dont even agree life much less intelligent life right thats argument humility saying could intelligent life different character right like could imagine dolphins intelligent never invent space travel live ocean dont thumbs right never invent technology never invent smelting maybe universe full intelligent species dont make technology right thats compatible data think think maybe youre pointing even versions intelligence intelligence intermolecular clouds surface neutron star galaxies giant things equivalent heartbeat 100 million years one hand yes open minded things hand us share laws physics might something laws physics even though dont currently know exactly thing would makes meters years right length timescales intelligent life maybe made atoms atoms certain size orbit stars stars certain lifetime impossible theres sweet spot intelligent life find im open minded either way im open minded either humble theres sorts different kinds life theres reason dont know yet life like kind life thats yeah im two minds often wonder brains designed quite obviously operate see world timescales almost blind tools weve created detecting things blind kind observation needed see intelligent life scales well im totally open heres another argument would make looked intelligent life weve looked dumbest way turning radio telescopes sky world would super advanced civilization randomly beam radio signals wastefully directions universe doesnt make sense especially order think would actually contact another civilization would forever keep millions years sounds like waste resources thought solar systems planets around maybe intelligent life didnt yet exist might someday wouldnt try talk radio waves would send spacecraft would park around would like point view itd like 2001 monolith monolith could artifact fact way works also right could artifacts solar system put technologically advanced civilizations thats eventually contact havent explored solar system well enough yet find reason dont think young impatient right like would take lifetime actually send something another star system wait come back start thinking hundreds thousands years million year time scales thats clearly right thing excited thing elon musk spacex general space idea space exploration even though species young impatient yeah think space travel crucially important long term even star systems think many people overestimate difficulty say look travel 1 speed light another star system well dead get right think much easier therefore write science fiction stories imagine wed go faster speed light otherwise theyre impatient right gonna go faster speed light could easily imagine human lifespan gets extended thousands years stars much closer effectively right whats hundred year trip right think thats gonna future far future lifetime baby steps unless lifetime gets extended well race time right friend mine actually thinks things said know gonna die dont know grandchildren thats dont know predicting future hard thats least plausible scenario yeah think discussed earlier threats earth known unknown right spread humanity biology elsewhere really important longterm goal kind questions science currently answer might soon think problems mysteries us may within reach science think obvious one origin life dont know happened theres difficulty knowing happened historically actually know literally earth starting life non life something kind think close right really really think like difficult start life well ive talked people including podcast know life requires three things life know theres difference life knows life know talk intelligence life know requires compartmentalization need like little membrane around cell metabolism need take food eat let make things replication okay need information pass future generations lab compartmentalization seems pretty easy hard make lipid bilayers come little cellular walls pretty easily metabolism replication hard replication close people made rna like molecules lab think state art theyre able make one molecule reproduces theyre able make two molecules reproduce thats okay thats pretty close metabolism harder believe even though sort obvious thing want sort controlled metabolism actual cellular machinery bodies quite complicated hard see popping existence probably took making progress fact dont think spending nearly enough money nsf would flood area money would change view world could actually make life lab understand made originally earth im sure itd ripple effects help cure disease mean understanding synthetic biology wonderful big frontier making cells right best way borrow heavily existing biology right well craig venter several years ago created artificial cell tremendous accomplishment take dna cell put entirely new dna let boot go leap creating intelligent life earth yeah define intelligence course lets even say homo sapiens modern intelligence human brain sense whats involved leap big leap ai would count really want life want really organism sense ai would count think okay yeah course course ai would count well lets say artificial consciousness right think threshold creating artificial consciousness think possible im educated close impression really close understand little understand consciousness dont idea hard imagine threshold making doable possible dont see obstacles principle yeah would hold interest happening eventually think general consciousness think would surprised easy consciousness create intelligence think consciousness thing thats something fake well good actually like idea fact consciousness way less mysterious think every time every moment less conscious think right fool things think plus idea artificial intelligent systems put body right give robot body help faking lot yeah think creating consciousness artificial consciousness simple asking roomba say im conscious refusing talked could could mean im almost silly thats thats kind consciousness also social construct lot ideas intelligence social construct reaching bar involves something thats beyond doesnt necessarily involve fundamental understanding go electrons neurons cognition actually think extremely good point fact suggests yeah referred kate darling podcast experiments simple robots look like animals look like theyre experiencing pain human beings react negatively little robots looking like theyre experiencing pain wanna say yeah theyre robots really pain right electrons going around realize electrons going around thats pain also would easy time imagining spectrum simple little robots kate works human things sort strict definition turing test level thing conscious nevertheless walk talk like theyre conscious could future mean siri close right might future lot agents like fact rather someday going aha consciousness well creep accurate reflections expect future maybe present example havent met youre basically assuming im human high probability time yeah future might question marks around right yeah absolutely certainly videos almost point shouldnt trust already photos cant trust right videos easier trust getting worse getting better faking right yeah physical embodied people whats hard faking depressing conversation right mean exciting youre exciting sobering thought bad right imagining next 50 years gonna like middle phase transition right yeah general im blind threats excited power technology solve protect us threats evolve im much steven pinker optimistic world everything ive seen brilliant people world ive met good people army good terms development technology large okay youre way optimistic think goodness badness equally distributed among intelligent unintelligent people dont see much correlation interesting neither us proof yeah exactly opinions free right definitions good evil come without definitions without data opinions kind questions science currently answer may never able answer view well obvious one good bad right wrong think questions science tells us happens world doesnt say world part world part world ability feel like somethings right somethings wrong make long story short think idea moral philosophy systematizing intuitions right wrong science might able predict ahead time wont ever able judge whether done youre kind unique terms scientists listen doesnt podcasts even reaching think referred sort interdisciplinary science reach talk people outside discipline always hope thats science fact little disillusioned realized academia siloed yeah question level prepare conversations think conversations open mind enough conversations may little bit broader advise scientists kinds conversations podcast fact youre podcast awesome people get hear also good without mics general good question tough one answer think guy know whos personal trainer asked podcast psych workout make discipline go work hes like asking cant stop working dont need psych likewise asked get interdisciplinary conversations sorts different things sorts different people im like thats makes go right like thats couldnt stop long recorded fact lot motivation starting recording making sure would read books purchased right like books wanted read enough time read motivation cause im gonna interview pat churchland im gonna finally read book know absolutely true academia extraordinarily siloed right dont talk people rarely fact punished know like people successfully generally first became successful within little siloed discipline start expanding youre young person know graduate students try candid know graduate students become faculty members right tough road live life wanna live eyes open job chances broad less time spend hyper specializing field lower job chances thats academic reality terrible dont like reality people thats fine like theres plenty people wonderful scientists zero interest branching talking things anyone outside field disillusioning know romantic notion intellectual academic life belied reality idea reach beyond discipline positive good rare universities may well exist said even though youre saying youre like personal trainer cant help youre also inspiration others like could speak know also career im thinking right without podcast may right makes realize kinds conversations kind science many ways reason write papers exchange ideas much harder interdisciplinary papers would say conversations easier conversations beginning field ai obvious think outside pure computer vision competitions particular data sets think broader impact know reaching physics psychology neuroscience conversations youre inspiration never know world changes mean fact stuff ive huge number people come grad students really loving podcast inspired probably theyll ripple effects become faculty end balance pessimism optimism sean thank much talking awesome lex thank much conversation great\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n

        "When analyzing the results from BERT and TF-IDF for different queries, distinct differences in their effectiveness become apparent. For the query `['gpt']`, BERT provides results that are highly relevant to the topic of artificial intelligence and technology. The top results include titles like *\"Virtual Reality, Social Media & the Future of ...\"* and *\"Neuralink, AI, Autopilot, and the Pale Blue Dot\"*. These results reflect a deeper understanding of the context and semantic relationships around the term \"GPT.\" In contrast, TF-IDF yields results that are less contextually aligned with the query. Although it includes relevant topics such as *\"OpenAI Codex, GPT-3, Robotics, and the Future ...\"*, the overall relevance is lower compared to BERTâ€™s results.\n",
        "\n",
        "For the query `['virtuality']`, BERT again demonstrates its strength by returning results that are closely related to the themes of reality, science, and philosophy. Titles like *\"Revolutionary Ideas in Science, Math, and Society\"* and *\"Nature of Reality, Dreams, and Consciousness\"* show that BERT can effectively interpret and match the semantic context of \"virtuality.\" On the other hand, TF-IDF results are less specific and often less relevant. For instance, results such as *\"Python and the Source Code of Humans, Computer ...\"* and *\"Life 3.0\"* do not align as well with the thematic essence of the query.\n",
        "\n",
        "When the query is `['physics']`, BERT continues to deliver results that are relevant to the topic of physics and related sciences, showing a good understanding of the context. Results such as *\"Totalitarianism and Anarchy\"* (though not directly relevant, could be interpreted within a broader context) and *\"Virtual Reality, Social Media & the Future of ...\"* highlight BERTâ€™s ability to grasp the conceptual relevance of \"physics.\" Conversely, TF-IDF provides results that are more directly related to the specific term \"physics,\" such as *\"String Theory\"* and *\"Physics View of the Mind and Neurobiology.\"* While these results are more precise in terms of keyword matching, they may miss out on broader contextual relevance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, BERT excels in understanding and capturing the context and semantic relationships of queries, making it more effective for complex and abstract searches. It provides results that reflect a deeper comprehension of the queryâ€™s intent. In contrast, TF-IDF is better suited for searches where exact term matching is crucial. Although it may offer more straightforward results for specific keywords, it often lacks the ability to grasp the deeper contextual meaning of the query.\n"
